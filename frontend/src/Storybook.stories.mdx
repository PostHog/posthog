# Welcome to Storybook

Click the links on the left:

- **Components** - Not sure what `<Tag />` to use? Check here first.
- **Scenes** - Here we develop the PostHog App using mocked API calls.

We're using Storybook to:
- track the difference between designed and implemented product decisions.
- make it easy to work on hard-to-reach scenes (e.g. preflight check)
- provide permalinks with which to link to stories in issues

## Running locally

To run storybook locally, run `yarn storybook`. It'll open on [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)
