# Welcome to Storybook

We'll be showcasing what the PostHog app can do inside this Storybook, and using it to track the difference between designed and
implemented product decisions.

<div className="subheading">How to create stories</div>

While developing, run `getReduxState()` inside the JS console and save the object as a `.json` file. Then follow what
the other `*.stories.tsx` files do.

<div className="subheading">Fun story: PostHog Onboarding Story</div>

For a fun story, check out [The Self-Hosted Onboarding Flow](/story/posthog-onboarding-1-preflight--initial), where a user
has to go through three different designs before reaching the app they came for!
