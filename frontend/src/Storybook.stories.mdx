# The PostHog Storybook

We're using Storybook to:
- track the difference between designed and implemented product decisions.
- make it easy to work on hard-to-reach scenes (e.g. preflight check)
- provide permalinks with which to link to stories in issues

## How to create stories

While developing, run `getReduxState()` inside the JS console and save the object as a `.json` file. Then follow what
the other `*.stories.tsx` files do.

```tsx
// Events.stories.tsx
import { Meta } from '@storybook/react'
import { keaStory } from 'lib/storybook/kea-story'

// import the main component of the scene
import { Events } from '../Events'

// import the `getReduxState()` output for all the variations you wish to show
import eventsState from './events.json'

// some metadata and optional parameters
export default {
    title: 'PostHog/Scenes/Events',
} as Meta

// export more stories with different state
export const AllEvents = keaStory(Events, eventsState)


```
