# Welcome to Storybook

We'll be showcasing what the PostHog app can do inside this Storybook, and using it to track the difference between designed and
implemented product decisions.

## How to create stories

While developing, run `getReduxState()` inside the JS console and save the object as a `.json` file. Then follow what
the other `*.stories.tsx` files do.

```tsx
// Signup.stories.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { ComponentMeta } from '@storybook/react'
import { KeaStory } from 'lib/storybook/kea-story'

import { Signup } from '../Signup'

import signup from './signup.json'

export default {
    title: 'PostHog/Onboarding/2 Signup',
    component: Signup,
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Signup>

export const Initial = (): JSX.Element => (
    <KeaStory state={signup}>
        <Signup />
    </KeaStory>
)

```

has to go through three different designs before reaching the app they came for!
