## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Adding Widgets to Dashboard

```typescript
import { 
    EnhancedMarketingDashboard,
    MarketingAttributionWidget,
    ROASCalculatorWidget 
} from 'scenes/dashboard/widgets'

// Use the comprehensive dashboard
<EnhancedMarketingDashboard 
    dashboardId={123}
    title="Marketing Attribution Dashboard"
/>

// Or individual widgets
<MarketingAttributionWidget 
    dashboardId={123}
    attributionModel="time_decay"
    conversionWindow={30}
/>

<ROASCalculatorWidget
    dashboardId={123}
    adPlatform="google_ads"
    currency="USD"
/>
```

### Setting Up Revenue Webhooks

```python
from products.marketing_analytics.backend.revenue_tracking import (
    generate_webhook_urls,
    RevenueEventProcessor
)

# Generate webhook URLs for your team
webhook_urls = generate_webhook_urls(team_id=123)

# Process custom revenue events
processor = RevenueEventProcessor(team)
revenue_event = RevenueEvent(
    transaction_id="txn_123",
    customer_id="user_456", 
    amount=Decimal("99.99"),
    currency="USD",
    gateway="stripe",
    properties={"utm_source": "google", "utm_campaign": "black-friday"}
)
event = processor.process_revenue_event(revenue_event)
```

### Using Attribution Models

```python
from products.marketing_analytics.backend.attribution_models import (
    AttributionAnalyzer,
    generate_attribution_hogql_query
)

# Analyze attribution with different models
analyzer = AttributionAnalyzer(team_id=123)

# Compare all attribution models
results = analyzer.compare_attribution_models(
    conversion_events=['purchase', 'subscription_started'],
    days=30
)

# Generate HogQL query for first-touch attribution
query = generate_attribution_hogql_query(
    model_type='first_touch',
    conversion_events=['purchase'],
    days=30
)
```
