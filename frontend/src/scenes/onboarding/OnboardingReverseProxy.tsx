                <p>A reverse proxy allows you to send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain.</p>
                <p>
                    This means that events are sent from your own domain and are less likely to be intercepted by
                    tracking blockers. You'll be able to capture more usage data without having to self-host PostHog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting up a reverse proxy means setting up a service to redirect requests from a subdomain you
                    choose (like <span className="font-mono break-keep">e.yourdomain.com</span>) to PostHog. It is best
                    practice to use a subdomain that does not include posthog, analytics, tracking, or other similar
                    words.
