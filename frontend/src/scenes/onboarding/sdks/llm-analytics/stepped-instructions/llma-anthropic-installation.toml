These SDKs **do not** proxy your calls. They only fire off an async call to PostHog in the background to send the data.

You can also use LLM analytics with other SDKs or our API, but you will need to capture the data in the right format. See the schema in the [manual capture section](/docs/llm-analytics/installation/manual-capture) for more details.
