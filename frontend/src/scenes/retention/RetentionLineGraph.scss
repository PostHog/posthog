// Here we override based on retention-container the graph-container styling, so
// as to not change the global styling. We need the extra nesting to ensure we
// are more specific than the other insights css
// NOTE: I get different css ordering in storybooks as opposed to via `yarn
// start-http` so that's something to watch out for if you update this
