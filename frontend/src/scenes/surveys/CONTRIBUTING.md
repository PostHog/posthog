# Surveys

## How to test changes

### PostHog App Changes (Backend/Frontend)

-   Run the app locally following the [local development guide](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/developing-locally)
-   Write tests for logic changes, especially in `surveyLogic.tsx` or `surveysLogic.tsx`

### JS SDK Changes

Most survey logic lives in the [PostHog JS SDK](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/). To test changes:

1. Use the [NextJS playground](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/tree/main/playground/nextjs) (recommended)

2. To test SDK changes in the main PostHog app:
    - Update `package.json` to use your local SDK:
    ```json
    "posthog-js": "file:../posthog-js"
    ```
    - Restart the frontend process after running `bin/start`

Because of RemoteConfig, you'll likely need to run the main PostHog app with your local posthog-js files to see the changes.

### Mobile Device Testing

To test on mobile devices, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose localhost:

1. Sample `ngrok.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
agent:
    authtoken: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
tunnels:
    web:
        proto: http
        addr: 8010
        host_header: rewrite
        subdomain: posthog-web-test
    app:
        proto: http
        addr: 3000
        subdomain: posthog-app-test
```

2. Add this `.env` configuration:

```env
# Core URLs
SITE_URL=https://posthog-web-test.ngrok.io
JS_URL=https://posthog-web-test.ngrok.io

# CORS and security
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=true
CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*,localhost,localhost:8010,127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1:8010,posthog-web-test
DISABLE_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
SECURE_COOKIES=False

# Proxy settings
IS_BEHIND_PROXY=true
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST=true
USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT=true
TRUST_ALL_PROXIES=true

# Debug settings
DEBUG=true
DJANGO_DEBUG=true
SERVE_STATIC=true
```

Using reserved ngrok domains is recommended to:

-   Maintain consistent URLs between sessions
-   Avoid CORS issues by keeping the same origin

One caveat: **reserved ngrok domains are only available for paid ngrok users.**

## Debugging

### posthog-js logs

We [added some logging on the JS SDK](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/1663) to help debug issues with surveys.

However, those logs are only enabled when posthog-js (v1.117.0 and higher) is set with debug=true.

For customer issues, if you need it, you can add the query parameter `__posthog_debug=true` to force the JS SDK to be loaded with debugging mode.

Example: `https://posthog.com/?__posthog_debug=true`

If you ever need more logs, please create a PR and add them.

### Cache Consistency Issues

When surveys are not loaded in the SDKs (/decide returns surveys: false), it could be caused by cache inconsistencies in the team settings.

#### What is `surveys_opt_in` and why it matters

The `surveys_opt_in` field on the Team model is a critical flag that determines whether surveys functionality is enabled for a team. During the `/decide` API call (which the SDK makes on initialization), this value is checked to determine if survey functionality should be loaded.

How it works:

-   The `/decide` endpoint includes `"surveys": surveys_opt_in` in its response
-   The RemoteConfig system also includes this value in its cached configuration
-   When the JS SDK initializes, it checks this value to determine if it should load survey functionality
-   If `surveys_opt_in` is `false` in the cache but `true` in the database (or vice versa), surveys may not work correctly

If cache inconsistencies occur, customers may report that their surveys aren't appearing despite being properly configured, or surveys may continue to appear after being disabled.

When to use:

-   When the /decide API response shows surveys_opt_in as false, but surveys are configured and should be active in the app.

```python
# In Django shell (python manage.py shell_plus)
from posthog.models.surveys.debug import (
    check_team_cache_consistency,
    fix_team_cache_consistency,
    find_teams_with_cache_inconsistencies,
    fix_all_teams_cache_consistency
)

# Check single team
check_team_cache_consistency("team_id_or_token")

# Fix single team
fix_team_cache_consistency("team_id_or_token")

# Find all teams with issues (only active survey teams)
find_teams_with_cache_inconsistencies()

# Fix all teams with issues
fix_all_teams_cache_consistency()
```

### Database debugging

Access the database via Django admin, you can do so by opening:

https://{eu|us}.posthog.com/admin/posthog/survey/{survey_id}/change/

Access the database via Metabase, you can do so by opening:

-   [EU](https://metabase.prod-eu.posthog.dev/browse/databases/34-posthog-postgres-prod-eu) - Posthog Survey
-   [US](https://metabase.prod-us.posthog.dev/browse/databases/34-posthog-postgres-prod-us-aurora) - Posthog Survey

You can execute SQL queries directly in Metabase.

```sql
select * from posthog_survey
 where id = '{survey_id}'
```

Access postgres directly, check the [runbook](http://runbooks/postgres#accessing-postgres) (internal PostHog link).
