# Hello from Storybook

## Here you will find

-   **Components** - Storybook is our component library. Before building a new component, check here first
    [and use](/docs/how-to-use-components--page) an existing one if possible.
    When building a new component, [create a story](/docs/how-to-create-stories--page#component-stories) for it.
    Have a look at the [TaxonomicPopup](/docs/filters-taxonomicpopup--taxonomic-string-popup-one-category) or
    [LemonSwitch](/docs/components-lemon-switch--lemon-switch) for example.
-   **Scenes** - Most scenes in PostHog, with data, accessible with a click, no backend required. Including
    [all](/story/scenes-app-insights--trends-line-breakdown), [types](/story/scenes-app-insights--lifecycle),
    [of](/story/scenes-app-insights--trends-pie-breakdown), [insights](/story/scenes-app-insights--funnel-left-to-right-breakdown)
    and even [the toolbar](/story/scenes-other-toolbar--authenticated). There's also a [guide on building new scenes](/docs/how-to-build-a-scene--page)
    if you're into that kind of stuff.
-   **Forms** - Coming sooner than you expect: reusable components and [methodology for building forms](/docs/how-to-build-a-form--page) with React + Kea.
