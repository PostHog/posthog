# Hello from Storybook

## Here you will find

- **Components** - Storybook is our component library. Before building a new component, check here first
  [and use](/docs/how-to-use-components--page) an existing one if possible.
  When building a new component, [create a story](/docs/how-to-create-stories--page#component-stories) for it.
  Have a look at the [TaxonomicPopover](/docs/filters-taxonomicpopover--taxonomic-string-popover-one-category) or
  [LemonSwitch](/docs/components-lemon-switch--lemon-switch) for example.
- **Scenes** - Most scenes in PostHog, with data, accessible with a click, no backend required. Including
  [all](/story/scenes-app-insights--trends-line-breakdown), [types](/story/scenes-app-insights--lifecycle),
  [of](/story/scenes-app-insights--trends-pie-breakdown), [insights](/story/scenes-app-insights--funnel-left-to-right-breakdown)
  and even [the toolbar](/story/scenes-other-toolbar--authenticated). There's also a [guide on building new scenes](/docs/how-to-build-a-scene--page)
  if you're into that kind of stuff.
- **Forms** - Coming sooner than you expect: reusable components and [methodology for building forms](/docs/how-to-build-a-form--page) with React + Kea.
