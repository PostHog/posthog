# Lemon UI

Lemon UI is a suite of building blocks powering PostHog's frontend. These components are abstract in nature so they
can be used in any context, and are made to fit together. In this section you can find helpful samples, along with
documentation of available parameters. All the other sections depend on this one.

## Transition from Ant Design

Lemon UI has grown as a replacement for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), from which we've started transitioning away
after onboarding our first product designer, Chris. The quality of our UI has been steadily going up since then,
but the transition process is not complete yet.

**Your** awareness is needed for us to transition sucessfully. Please **DO NOT** use the following Ant components when building new UI:

- `Button` – instead go for `LemonButton`
- `Select` – instead go for `LemonSelect`
- `Input` – instead go for `LemonInput`
- `Table` – instead go for `LemonTable`
- `Checkbox` – instead go for `LemonCheckbox`
- `Spin` – instead go for `Spinner`
- `Alert` – instead go for `AlertMessage`
- `Typography` – just use HTML elements
- `Modal` – instead go for `LemonModal`
- `Divider` – instead go for `LemonSpacer`
- `Row` – instead go for `LemonRow` (for standard rows of content) or roll your own `display: flex` as needed (for general layout)
- `Col` – roll your own `display: flex` as needed

## Design principles

- Layout is based on an 8px by 8px grid, so component dimensions/paddings/margins should be multiples of 8px (0.5rem)
- Lemon Icons are generally [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) with some matching in-house additions based
- Icons are based on a 24px (1.5rem) square viewbox
- Icons contents are 18px (1.125rem) or smaller
