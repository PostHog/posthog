# We use an older version of rdkafka for cymbal specifically because the newer version
# has a bug which causes consumers to hang when offset auto-storing is disabled and the
# program is producing and consuming at the same time. Cymbal is the only rust service
# that does this, and 0.35 is significantly lower-performance than 0.36, so rather than
# rolling back all other rust services (particularly capture and propdefs), we just have
# cymbal use the older version by overriding the workspace setting. The tracking issue
# for this is: https://github.com/fede1024/rust-rdkafka/issues/638

# We don't rely on common-kafka due to the bug mentioned above

# This does force us to take a direct dependency on join_all
