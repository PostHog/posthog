-- When a job is dequeued, it is locked by generating a UUID and returning it to the dequeuing
-- worker. Any worker that can't provide the correct lock_id when updating will have their updates
-- rejected. The reason this is important is because if, e.g., a worker holds a job in a running
-- state without updating the heartbeat, the janitor will return the job to the queue eventually,
-- and if the worker /then/ tries to update the job after another worker has picked it up, that's a
-- race. We track transition count and times alongside lock_id's and heartbeats for reporting and
-- debugging purposes, and we track the number of times the janitor has touched a job to spot poison
-- pills.
