// The worker's interface to the underlying queue system - a worker can do everything except
// create jobs (because job creation has to be shard-aware).

// This interface looks stange, because a lot of things that would normally be done with lifetimes
// and references are done with uuid's instead (and we lose some nice raii stuff as a result), but
// the reason for this is that this is designed to be embedded in other runtimes, where handing out
// lifetime'd references or things with drop impls isn't really practical. This makes it a little
// awkward to use, but since it's meant to be the core of other abstractions, I think it's ok for
// now (client libraries should wrap this to provide better interfaces).
