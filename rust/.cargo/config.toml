# Unlocks Tokio's unstable RuntimeMetrics API (per-worker poll counts, blocking pool stats, etc.).
# Used by feature-flags/src/tokio_monitor.rs — no other crate calls unstable APIs.
# Applies workspace-wide because Cargo doesn't support per-crate config within a workspace.

# Force SQLX to run in offline mode for CI. Devs can change this if they want, to live code against the DB,
# but we use it at the workspace level here to allow use of sqlx macros across all crates
