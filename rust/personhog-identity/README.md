# personhog-identity

The identity service of the personhog cluster. It owns the identity graph — distinct id resolution and get-or-create orchestration — per the personhog-identity saga RFC.

Person state spans two planes:

- the sync plane (Postgres primary), which owns existence, identity topology, and lifecycle scalars
- the async plane (leader + changelog), which owns person property content

`GetOrCreatePersonByDistinctId` / `GetOrCreatePersonsByDistinctIds` orchestrate both planes so a single ack covers both: `created = true` means the person stub is committed in Postgres AND the initial `$set`/`$set_once` are durable in the leader's changelog. The identity service never runs a saga; person-destroying operations (merge case 3, delete) belong to the lifecycle manager.

## How get-or-create works

1. Batch resolve `(team_id, distinct_id)` keys on the Postgres primary (one UNNEST probe).
2. Misses get a person stub — deterministic uuidv5 of `team_id:distinct_id`, version 0, empty properties — plus distinct id rows, in one multi-row transaction with per-row `ON CONFLICT` handling. Extra distinct ids carry personless history forward (version 1 when a `posthog_personlessdistinctid` row already existed).
3. Created stubs fan out initial properties to their owning leaders through the router (`UpdatePersonProperties` with `x-team-id`/`x-person-id` routing headers), with bounded concurrency.

Races resolve per key, never failing the rest of a batch: a concurrent create conflicts on the deterministic uuid and returns the winner (`created = false`); a distinct id concurrently mapped elsewhere rolls back only that stub and re-resolves. A crash between the stub commit and the leader ack surfaces as a per-key error; the retried key resolves to the stub (`created = false`) and the caller applies properties through the normal update path.

## Layout

- `src/service/` — gRPC surface; `mod.rs` is dispatch-only, each RPC family has its own module (`get_or_create.rs`)
- `src/storage/` — `IdentityStorage` trait + Postgres implementation (primary pool only; identity reads must never be stale)
- `src/leader.rs` — `PropertyWriter` trait + router-backed implementation
- Shared person primitives (row type, storage errors, uuidv5 scheme) live in `personhog-common::persons`

## Running locally

```bash
bin/start-rust-service personhog-identity   # gRPC :50055, metrics :9108
```

Tests need the persons database (`posthog_persons`) with `rust/persons_migrations` applied:

```bash
cargo test -p personhog-identity
```
