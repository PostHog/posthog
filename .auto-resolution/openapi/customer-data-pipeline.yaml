    title: Customer Data Pipeline
    description: |
        The Customer Data Pipeline (CDP) is a service that allows users to
        upload data to the platform. It allows users to specify `Destination`s
        to which the data should be sent, and `Source`s from which the data is
        sent from the client.

        Destinations can be of type 'webhook' only currently. The CDP service
        will send a POST request to the webhook URL with the data in the body
        of the request. A basic transformation can be specified to transform
        event data into the format required by the destination.
