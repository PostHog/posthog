Django-Related Dependencies in the Django 5.0 Upgrade
Core Django Extensions & Middleware
	•	django-axes (login attempt tracking): Currently at 5.9.0 (Nov 2020), which is very outdated. The latest 8.0.0 (May 2025) explicitly added Django 5 support (support for Django 5.0 was added in v6.4.0). Upgrading is advisable to ensure full compatibility with Django 5.
	•	django-cors-headers (CORS headers): You have 3.5.0 (Oct 2022). The library is now at 4.8.0 (Sept 2025) and officially supports Django 5.0–5.2. While 3.5.0 may function, consider updating to the 4.x series for better Django 5 support and bug fixes.
	•	django-extensions (utilities): Your version 3.1.2 is behind. Latest 4.1 (Apr 2025) requires Django 4.2+ and supports Django 5.1/5.2pypi.org. Upgrading will drop old compatibility code and ensure all features work on Django 5.
	•	django-filter (queryset filtering): You’re on 2.4.0 (2020). The project switched to CalVer; current release is 25.1 (Feb 2025) supporting Django 5.x. Version 2.4.0 is very old – upgrading will pull in years of improvements and official Django 5 compatibility.
	•	django-picklefield (pickled model field): You have 3.0.1 (2020). The latest is 3.3.0 (Mar 2025). Newer versions likely include fixes and testing for modern Django – consider updating since 3.0.1 predates Django 5 by a long time.
	•	whitenoise (static file serving): Version 6.5.0 (June 2023) was the first to support Python 3.12. Subsequent releases added Django 5 support (e.g. 6.6.0 added 5.0 supportwhitenoise.readthedocs.io and 6.9.0 added 5.2 supportwhitenoise.readthedocs.io). Your 6.5.0 should work on Django 5.0, but upgrading to the latest 6.x (now 6.10.0) will ensure support through Django 5.2 and include bug fixes.
Authentication & Security Libraries
	•	django-two-factor-auth (2FA): You’re on 1.16.0 (Feb 2024). The latest 1.18.0 (Sept 2025) supports Django 5.0–5.2. There were minor releases after 5.0’s debut, so upgrading is wise to pick up any Django 5-related fixes. (1.16.0 was likely tested with Django 5.0, but 1.17/1.18 add full support).
	•	social-auth-app-django (social login): You have 5.0.0; current version is 5.5.1. While not tightly coupled to Django internals, newer releases may contain security patches and improved Django 5 compatibility. Similarly, social-auth-core is at 4.3.0 for you, with 4.7.0 now available (June 2025). Upgrading both is recommended to stay up-to-date with provider changes and any Django 5 adjustments.
	•	django-axes (security/brute-force protection): (See above in Core Extensions.) Your version is from 2020 and does not include the official Django 5 support added in 2024. This library hooks into login signals and database models, so using an updated version (6.x+ or ideally 8.x) is important to avoid subtle issues.
	•	django-oauth-toolkit (OAuth2 provider): Your requirement is >=3.0.1, and 3.0.1 (Sept 2024) is the latest. This version supports Django 5.0/5.1 officially. As long as you have 3.0.1 installed, you’re on the newest release, and it’s compatible with Django 5. No critical updates needed here beyond ensuring you are indeed on 3.0.1.
Django REST Framework & Extensions
	•	djangorestframework (DRF): You’re on 3.15.1. DRF 3.15 already added Django 5.0 support (it was the first DRF release to support Django 5 and Python 3.12). The latest DRF is 3.16.1 (Aug 2025) supporting up to Django 5.2. It’s not critical if 3.15.1 is working for you, but consider moving to 3.16 for the newest fixes and support matrix.
	•	drf-spectacular (OpenAPI schema): You have 0.27.2 (Apr 2024). There is a 0.28.0 release (as of 2025). v0.27.2 already supports Django 5.0; upgrading to 0.28 will ensure compatibility with the latest DRF and any schema generation improvements.
	•	drf-extensions: You’re on 0.7.0 (Feb 2021). After a long gap, 0.8.0 was released in April 2025 with support for Django 5.2. The 0.7.x version was not officially tested on Django 5. Upgrading to 0.8.0 is highly recommended, as this library extends DRF internals (caching, mixins, etc.) which may break subtly on newer Django/DRF without the update.
	•	djangorestframework-csv (CSV renderer): Version 2.1.1 (May 2021) is old. The latest 3.0.2 (Dec 2023) was released around the Django 5 timeframe. It likely includes fixes for compatibility with DRF 3.14+ and Django 5. Since 2.1.1 is beta-quality and two years behind, upgrading is advisable if you use this renderer (the 3.x fork modernized the package).
	•	djangorestframework-dataclasses: You have 1.2.0. The newest is 1.4.0 (May 2025). Updating will pull in support for Python 3.11+ and possibly adjustments for Django 5/DRF 3.15+. If everything works now you’re not in immediate danger, but 1.2.0 predates Django 5 – for forward-compatibility, consider 1.4.0.
	•	drf-exceptions-hog (PostHog’s DRF error formatter): Current version 0.4.0 (May 2023) is actually the latest. It’s maintained by PostHog. This package standardizes DRF error responses and isn’t known to have Django-version-specific issues (it mainly plugs into DRF’s exception handler). Since everything is working on Django 5, no action needed here – just note it supports Python 3.7–3.9 officially, but evidently runs on 3.11 as used in your project. Keep an eye on its repository in case a Django 5.x compatibility update appears, though none is noted so far.
Logging & Monitoring
	•	django-structlog (structured logging): Your version 2.1.3 (Sept 2021) is extremely behind. The project has jumped to 9.1.1 (April 2025), with many changes. Early 2.x supported Django 3.x, so it hasn’t been updated for Django 4/5 in your version. Upgrading to the latest 9.x is strongly recommended – it will include proper support for new Django logging settings and Python versions. Staying on 2.1.3 might silently fail to capture logs or miss context on Django 5.
	•	django-prometheus (metrics): You have 2.2.0. The latest release is 2.3.1 (May 2023). Version 2.3.x includes updates for newer Django/Python (Debian notes show 2.3.1 packaged in 2024). While 2.2.0 (from late 2021) might still work, it was released before Django 5 existed. It’s advisable to move to 2.3.1, as it likely fixes minor incompatibilities and supports Django 4.2+.
	•	django-statsd (StatsD client): Your version 2.5.2 (2020) is outdated. The latest is 2.7.0 (July 2024), which spans the period of Django 5’s release. Upgrading is recommended – 2.7.0 added support for newer Django versions. Using 2.5.2 (last updated for Django 3.x) could silently skip metrics or not hook into middleware as expected on Django 5.
Developer Tools & Stubs
	•	django-linear-migrations: You require 2.16.*. The newest is 2.17.0 (likely Q1 2025)pypi.org. This Adam Johnson tool enforces linear migrations and has been updated to support Django 4.2–5.2pypi.org. If you stick with 2.16.x it should work on Django 5.0, but consider bumping to 2.17 for full Django 5.2+ support and any bug fixes.
	•	django-stubs (typing stubs for Django): You have ~5.1.3. Django-stubs tracks Django versions; the 5.1.x series covers Django 5.1. The latest as of now is 5.2.2 (supports Django 5.2). Upgrading your stubs will improve type-checking accuracy for Django 5.0+ (the 5.1.3 stubs should be mostly fine for 5.0/5.1, but updating to 5.2.x when you can will prepare you for Django 5.2 and beyond).
	•	djangorestframework-stubs: Your version (~3.14.5) targets DRF 3.14. The newest 3.16.2 (Aug 2025) aligns with DRF 3.16. Up-to-date stubs will ensure any new DRF API surfaces introduced in 3.15/3.16 (especially around Django 5 features) are covered. It’s a good idea to upgrade these when you upgrade DRF itself.
	•	pytest-django (testing): You’re on 4.5.2. The latest plugin version is 4.11.1, which supports Django 4.2, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2cloudsmith.com. Your 4.5.2 was released in mid-2021, likely supporting Django 3.x/4.0. It might not be aware of Django 5’s new behaviors. Upgrading to the 4.10+ range is recommended to avoid any subtle test issues. (Notably, newer pytest-django drops some old django compat shims and fully supports async views, etc., which could matter if your project uses those Django 5 features.)
Summary – Nothing Critical Blocking, But Updates Advised
In summary, no outright showstoppers were found – your Django 5.0 app is running, which means none of these dependencies have fatal incompatibilities with 5.0. However, many of your pinned versions are quite outdated and lack official Django 5 support. Especially for Django-centric libs (authentication, admin tools, caching, DRF add-ons, etc.), it’s best to upgrade to versions that explicitly support Django 5. This will prevent “silent” issues and ensure you get relevant bug fixes: for example, django-axes, django-structlog, drf-extensions, django-filter, django-redis, django-cors-headers, and django-statsd should be high on your update list given how outdated they are relative to Django 5’s release. The dev tools (type stubs and testing libs) should follow closely, to keep your development experience smooth with Django 5.0+cloudsmith.com.
Overall, there is nothing critically breaking in your current setup, but bringing these dependencies to their latest versions will give you peace of mind and better Django 5 support. I recommend prioritizing the obviously old packages (from 2020–2021) and those tied deeply to Django’s internals or request cycle, as listed above. This proactive maintenance will ensure your Django 5 upgrade is truly complete and future-proof.
