# Defines the environment you're dropped into with codespaces
# I've take
# https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/blob/main/containers/python-3/.devcontainer/Dockerfile
# and surrounding files as inspiration. I'm extending their image rather than
# building from e.g. the official python docker images as there appears to be
# quite a bit done as part of the vscode images, presumably to make the
# experience as rich as possible. Perhaps later down the line it might be worth
# rolling our own
#
# NOTE: I haven't tried to unify with `dev.Dockerfile` at this point. I want to
# understand what leaning into codespaces looks like first.
