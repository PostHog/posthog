    # The workspace environment you'll be dropped into. Note that I do not
    # create separate services for each process e.g. celery, the plugin server.
    # I expect these to be run from within this workspace context, such that you
    # do not need to interact with them via docker, the intent is to make them
    # readily debuggable.
    #
    # Service dependencies are, however, run separately as there isn't so much
    # of a need to debug them. You can of course however use `docker logs` (as we
    # have docker-in-docker enabled) to view these, of via the vscode docker
    # extention.
