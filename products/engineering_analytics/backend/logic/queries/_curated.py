"""The curated read layer over a team's GitHub warehouse tables.

``CuratedGitHubSource`` binds one team to its resolved ``pull_requests`` / ``workflow_runs``
table names (see ``logic.sources``) and is the single object the query modules use: it hands
out the curated ``SELECT`` subqueries and the CI rollup CTE, and runs the assembled HogQL.
The resolved table names live inside it, so the query layer never threads or re-derives them.
The product reads its data privately this way — nothing is registered as a global HogQL view,
keeping it off the per-query catalog hot path.

Every SQL fragment is built from trusted constants and the resolved table identifiers (which
the resolver has validated to ``[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*``). User-supplied values must always
flow through ``ast.Constant`` placeholders in the calling query, never be string-substituted
into these fragments.
