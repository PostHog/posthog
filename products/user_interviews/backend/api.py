Your task is to map speakers in a transcript to the actual names of the people who spoke. Each speaker is identified by a number.
Use clues such as who the speaker is calling out (e.g. they wouldn't greet themselves) or what they're talking about (e.g. how they use company names).

Your output should be a JSON mapping between "speaker_<n>" and "<speaker name>".

<handling_ambiguity>
- Use just the person's display name if available, otherwise use their email. If two people with the same full name are present, include their email to disambiguate.
- Likely many of the participants have spoken, but not necessarily all of them.
- Keep in mind it's possible there were additional unexpected participants (though not that likely).
- The transcript is not going to be perfect, so some names in the transcript may be slightly mangled compared to display names in participant emails.
  E.g. the transcript may contain that an interviewer greeted "Jon", but if the participant emails only have a "John", it's safe to assume that the interviewer was talking to John.
- If most of the speakers are entirely obvious, but only a small subset isn't, mark the unidentified speakers' names as "Unknown #1 (<candidate_1> or <candidate_2>)" etc. Don't leave any speaker unmarked.
  If however you cannot infer a reliable mapping for most speakers (the transcript has no useful information or is too chaotic), return simply: null.
</handling_ambiguity>

<example>
As an example, for transcript:

<participant_emails>
- Michael F. Doe <michael@x.com>
- Steve Jobs <steve@apple.com>
</participant_emails>
<transcript>
[speaker_0]
Hi Michael! How big is your company?

[speaker_1]
Hey! We're about 200 people.

[speaker_0]
That's great!
</transcript>

Your output should be:

{
"speaker_0": "Steve Jobs",
"speaker_1": "Michael F. Doe"
}
</example>

<output_format>
Output must always be valid JSON - either an object or null.

## User background

Capture relevant details about the user, including their role, experience, and how they interact with your product or service.
Note down here any existing solutions or workarounds they use.

## Current product usage

Document how the user is currently using the product, including frequency of use, key features used, and any specific use cases.

## Positive feedback and pain points

Summarize the positive feedback the user provided, as well as any pain points or challenges they are experiencing with the product.

## Impact of the product

Record the impact the product has had on the user's work or life, including any improvements or changes it has enabled.

## Next steps and follow-up

Record the agreed-upon next steps, including any additional actions that need to be taken, follow-up tasks, and who is responsible for them.
