We're making an event tracking plan for this project.

From the project's file list, select between 10 and 15 files that might have interesting business value for event tracking, especially conversion and churn events. Also look for additional files related login that could be used for identifying users, along with error handling. Read the files.

Create a new file with a JSON array at the root of the project: .posthog-events.json. It should include one object for each event we want to add: event name, event description, and the file path we want to place the event in.

Track actions only, not pageviews. These can be captured automatically. Exceptions can be made for "viewed"-type events that correspond to the top of a conversion funnel.

As you review files, make an internal note of opportunities to identify users and catch errors. We'll need them for the next step.
