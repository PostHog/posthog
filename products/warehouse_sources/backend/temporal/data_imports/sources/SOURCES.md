# Warehouse sources — implementation status & communication methods

This file is the authoritative inventory of every source registered in [`products/warehouse_sources/backend/temporal/data_imports/sources/__init__.py`](__init__.py),
the wire protocol it uses to talk to its upstream, and whether its outbound traffic is currently routed
through the [tracked HTTP transport](common/http/) (so it shows up in our HTTP logs, metrics, and
sample-capture pipeline).

Keep this file in sync as sources are added, implemented, or migrated. The [implementing-warehouse-sources
skill](/.agents/skills/implementing-warehouse-sources/SKILL.md) instructs agents to update it as part of any
new source / vendor-SDK / migration PR.

## Status legend

| Status          | Meaning                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implemented** | Source has working sync logic and is exposed to users (possibly behind `featureFlag=` or `releaseStatus="alpha"/"beta"`). |
| **Scaffolded**  | Source class is registered with `unreleasedSource=True` and an empty/placeholder `source.py`. No sync logic yet.          |

## Comm-method legend

| Method                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP**                  | REST/JSON over HTTPS via the `requests` library. Routed through `make_tracked_session()` (see [common/http/](common/http/)).                                     |
| **HTTP (vendor SDK)**     | The vendor ships its own SDK that wraps HTTP. Where the SDK exposes a session/transport hook, we inject `make_tracked_session()` so the calls are still tracked. |
| **gRPC**                  | The vendor SDK uses gRPC over HTTP/2 (binary, not REST). Routed through the [tracked gRPC transport](common/grpc/) via client interceptors (see `common/grpc/`). |
| **DB protocol**           | Native database wire protocol via a driver (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake). Not HTTP.                                                                        |
| **Webhook (S3-buffered)** | Vendor pushes events to a webhook endpoint; payloads are buffered to S3 by the `WebhookSourceManager` and consumed by the pipeline.                              |

When a source uses more than one transport (e.g. BigQuery REST + Storage gRPC, or Stripe pull-API + webhooks),
the row lists both.

## Tracked-transport legend

| State         | Meaning                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Tracked    | Outbound calls go through `make_tracked_session()` (or the equivalent vendor-SDK injection).                                            |
| ⚠️ Vendor SDK | Vendor SDK has no session/transport hook we can use. Outbound HTTP bypasses our logging/metrics today. May need a `# nosemgrep` pragma. |
| ➖ N/A        | Source uses a native DB wire protocol (Postgres, MySQL, Snowflake, …) — neither the HTTP nor gRPC transport applies.                    |
| —             | Source is scaffolded; no transport in use yet.                                                                                          |

### Notes on partially-tracked sources

- **bing_ads** uses Microsoft's `bingads` Python SDK, which builds its own HTTP transport via `suds-py3` for
  the SOAP API and a separate Reporting client. The SDK does not expose a session or HTTP-client injection
  hook today. Outbound traffic from this source bypasses the tracked transport.
- **linkedin_ads** uses `linkedin-api`'s `RestliClient`, which constructs its own internal `requests.Session`.
  We don't yet have a session-injection seam on it, so outbound calls bypass the tracked transport. (The file
  imports `requests` only for exception types — those references are expected and don't need a pragma.)
- **temporalio** talks gRPC, but the Python `temporalio` SDK runs its entire gRPC stack in a Rust core
  (`temporalio.bridge`, a PyO3 module) — service RPCs dispatch through `ServiceClient._rpc_call` into the
  bridge, so there is no Python `grpc.Channel` or client-interceptor seam for the tracked gRPC transport to
  wrap. (`Client.connect(interceptors=...)` accepts high-level `temporalio.client.Interceptor`s, a different
  abstraction that wouldn't feed the gRPC observer/metrics.) Outbound traffic bypasses the tracked transport.
- **bigquery** uses two transports: the metadata/management traffic via the BigQuery REST API is HTTP,
  tracked via `AuthorizedSession` + a mounted `TrackedHTTPAdapter`; the Storage Read API uses gRPC,
  tracked via `BigQueryReadGrpcTransport(channel=make_tracked_channel(...))` so `create_read_session` and
  `read_rows` ride the tracked gRPC interceptors.
- **google_ads** is pure gRPC. Every `GoogleAdsClient.get_service(...)` call passes
  `interceptors=tracked_interceptors(host)` so its unary calls (`search`, `search_google_ads_fields`) are
  logged, metered, and eligible for sample capture.

## Scaffolded sources

These are registered in `__init__.py` with `unreleasedSource=True` and a stub `source.py`. They have no
sync logic yet — picking up any of them means following the [implementing-warehouse-sources skill](/.agents/skills/implementing-warehouse-sources/SKILL.md).

One source per line (kept alphabetical) so adding or removing a source only touches its own line and
doesn't conflict with concurrent PRs.

## When to update this file

Update SOURCES.md whenever you:

- **Add a new source** (move it from the scaffolded list into the implemented table once it actually syncs).
- **Implement an existing scaffolded source** (move it into the implemented table; record the comm method
  and tracked-transport state).
- **Migrate a vendor SDK** to use `make_tracked_session()` (flip the source from ⚠️ to ✅).
- **Switch a source's protocol** (e.g. swap a REST client for a gRPC SDK, or add webhook support
  alongside the pull API).

Two semgrep rules enforce the tracked transports inside `sources/`:

- [`data-imports-http-transport`](/.semgrep/rules/data-imports-http-transport.yaml) bans direct
  `requests.<verb>` / `requests.Session()` / `httpx.*` — route through `make_tracked_session()`.
- [`data-imports-grpc-transport`](/.semgrep/rules/data-imports-grpc-transport.yaml) bans raw
  `grpc.*_channel(...)` and direct `BigQueryReadClient(...)` / `GoogleAdsClient(...)` construction —
  route through `make_tracked_channel(...)` (for `channel=`/`transport=` SDKs) or
  `tracked_interceptors(host)` (for `interceptors=` SDKs).

Vendor SDKs that genuinely cannot be intercepted should both:

1. Carry a `# nosemgrep: data-imports-...-transport-...` pragma at the call site, with a one-line reason.
2. Be listed here under "Notes on partially-tracked sources" with the `⚠️ Vendor SDK` row state.
