"""Feature flag facade: gated flag writes and read helpers for other products.

Every write routes through ``FeatureFlagSerializer`` — the only path that honors
``@approval_gate``, validation, and activity logging. Consumers (currently experiments)
call these functions instead of driving the serializer and its DRF context by hand.
The read helpers (``user_can_edit_flag``, ``flag_disable_requires_approval``,
``serialize_flags``) expose the flag API's access-control, approval-policy, and
representation logic behind the same boundary.

Writes do not enforce access control — that lives at the viewset layer. A caller
acting on behalf of an end user must pre-check ``user_can_edit_flag`` first.

Approval-gate ordering constraint for callers: a gated write can raise ``ApprovalRequired``
(surfacing as a 409 + change_request_id), which conflicts with ``transaction.atomic`` — the
exception propagating out of an atomic block would roll back the just-created pending
ChangeRequest. Run gated writes before/outside any transaction wrapping your own state.
