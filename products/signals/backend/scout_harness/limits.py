# A scout run's hard runtime cap. Enforced via the Temporal activity's
# `start_to_close_timeout` in `scout_scheduler.py` — if the agent is still going
# at this point, the activity is killed and the run row is marked failed by the
# bridge. Tuning this is a config decision, not a per-run override knob.

# Slack added on top of `DEFAULT_MAX_RUNTIME_S` for the Temporal activity
# `start_to_close_timeout`, so heartbeat-based failures get a chance to surface

# Hard ceiling on how long a single agent activity can actually be running. The
# workflow always sets `start_to_close_timeout = DEFAULT_MAX_RUNTIME_S + ACTIVITY_SLACK_S`,
# providing a heartbeat window before Temporal's own timeout fires. The stale-RUNNING
# self-heal in `runner.py` uses this as the staleness base.
