"""Run-history tools: read access to past `SignalScoutRun` rows for the team.

These are the agent's window into what previous runs concluded. Used for best-effort
dedupe ("have I seen this hypothesis recently?") and continuity ("what was I
working on yesterday?"). Strictly team-scoped — no cross-team reads.

`SignalScoutRun` is a thin bridge to `tasks.TaskRun`: status, timestamps, and
error all flow from the linked TaskRun via `select_related("task_run")`. The
scout-owned content on the row itself is `summary` — the one-paragraph close-out
the agent emits at end_turn, used as the dedupe key for runs that didn't emit any
findings (and so left no `Signal` row to query against) — plus the
`emitted_count` / `emitted_finding_ids` emit tally bumped post-success by
`emit_finding`. Findings are recoverable as emitted `Signal` rows keyed by
`source_id = run:<run_id>:finding:<finding_id>`.
