# PostHog AI agent-run surface — frontend guide

This directory is the **composable PostHog AI agent-run UI**: a conversation-agnostic library of surfaces
that render and drive an agent run (the streamed thread, tool cards, approvals, the composer). It is
consumed by the Max scene (`frontend/src/scenes/max`) and the signals inbox — and is meant to be
embeddable anywhere an agent run needs to be shown or interacted with. The standalone runner scene
(`TaskTracker`, the `/tasks` route) lives here too, under `scenes/`.

> This used to live under a `sandbox/` subfolder behind a `Sandbox*` codename prefix; it's now laid out
> conventionally directly under `frontend/` with the prefix dropped. The word "sandbox" that remains is the
> agent _runtime_ (`agent_runtime === 'sandbox'`), a real domain term — not the old codename.

## 1. The public API is the `api/<module>` facade

Every external consumer imports from a domain-scoped **`api/<module>`** entry — **never** from deep paths
(`components/...`, `logics/...`). The `api/` modules are the contract; internal files move freely behind
them. There are four tiers, split along dependency/side-effect boundaries (not cosmetics — that's what
preserves code-splitting). Consumers pick the **lowest tier** that does the job. The full decision table,
import rule, and copy-paste recipes live in the consumer-facing [`README.md`](./README.md); the summary:

| Tier                           | Module                               | What's in it                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 — Prepackaged surfaces**   | `api/readableRun` + `api/runSurface` | `ReadonlyRunSurface` (lazy, code-split read-only embed); the `RunSurface` compound (`Root` + slots, eager) for custom layouts                                                       |
| **2 — Compound primitives**    | `api/primitives`                     | `Thread` + atoms, `ThreadView`, `Composer.*`, `QueuedMessageList`, `RunLogSkeleton`, activity primitives + `RunActivity`, message presenters, permission/question/resource surfaces |
| **3 — Headless logic + types** | `api/logics` + `api/types`           | `runStreamLogic`, `runInteractionLogic`, status + thinking helpers; folded-thread + tool types                                                                                      |
| **4 — Extension seam**         | `api/tools`                          | `toolRegistry`, `registerToolRenderers`, `lookupToolRenderer`, `GenericMcpToolRenderer`, `DataToolRow`, `ToolActivity`, `FilePath`, diff helpers                                    |

**Why the split, not one flat barrel:** the tool registry registers built-ins at module load — a top-level
side effect that is _not_ tree-shaken. A single barrel statically re-exports it alongside the
markdown/virtualization-heavy thread and the headless logics, so a consumer wanting only
`isTerminalRunStatus` for a status badge would drag the registry + presenters into its chunk. Isolating the
side-effectful registry in `api/tools` and keeping the headless lane (`api/logics` + `api/types`) free of
React/registry imports is what keeps each consumer's bundle to its subtree.

There is deliberately **no root `index.ts` barrel**: a single aggregate that re-exports every tier would
re-fatten any consumer's chunk and undo the split. It also wouldn't match the repo norm — no other
`products/*/frontend` ships a barrel; consumers import the specific path they need. Every public symbol is
reached through an `api/<module>` entry; add new exports to the relevant tier module, not to a new barrel.

The headline exports per module:

- **`api/readableRun`** — **`ReadonlyRunSurface`**, the lazy, code-split read-only embed: calling
  `<ReadonlyRunSurface .../>` renders the run thread (and, for a live run, the meta bars) behind a
  `RunLogSkeleton` Suspense fallback — no composer, no approval prompt. The heavy chunk (the `RunSurface`
  compound — stream logic, virtualized thread, tool/diff renderers) is reached only through its dynamic
  `import()`, so importing this light module never statically pulls the impl. This is the form every **embed**
  uses (the inbox detail views), where the surface is a secondary panel worth splitting out. It streams fresh
  frames while running when `interaction='live'`, and replays the snapshot once when `'read-only'`.
- **`api/runSurface`** — the **`RunSurface`** compound (`Root` + the `.Thread/.Composer/.Resources/.ContextUsage`
  slots), **eager**, for consumers that build a **custom layout**. `RunSurface.Root` binds the stream logic and
  bootstraps the run; the slots compose into whatever layout the surface needs. `RunSurface.Composer` is the
  input-region slot — it owns prompt-vs-composer precedence (a pending approval/question replaces the composer)
  and the null-bootstrap gate, and takes the composer UI as `children`; omit it for no input region. The meta
  slots (`.Resources`/`.ContextUsage`) self-bind and self-hide when empty. There is **no default layout** — the
  prepackaged read-only embed (`ReadonlyRunSurface`) is one concrete composition; the runner scene
  (`scenes/TaskTracker/TaskRunChat`) composes its own live-composer layout. Because the compound is eager, import
  it only from an already route-split scene (the `/tasks` runner) or another lazily-loaded layout module — a
  light bundle that should stay split uses `api/readableRun` instead.
- **`api/primitives`** — **`Thread`** (Radix-style compound: `Thread.Root` is the virtualized presenter, the
  atoms `Thread.Message/.Markdown/.Reasoning/.Failure/.Activity/.ToolCall` are the building blocks for
  bespoke threads), **`Composer`** (logic-free compound input — the caller owns
  `value`/`onChange`/`onSubmit`), **`RunLogSkeleton`** (the shared "run log is loading" loader — the
  `ReadonlyRunSurface` Suspense fallback and the `RunSurface` bootstrap fallback, also used by the runner
  scene), activity primitives, message
  presenters, and the permission/question/resource surfaces.
- **`api/logics`** — **`runStreamLogic`** (SSE stream + thread projection, see §3),
  **`runInteractionLogic`** (Max-agnostic follow-up/queue facade), status helpers
  (`isTerminalRunStatus`, `INITIAL_PERMISSION_MODE`), and thinking-message helpers. Imports only
  `logics/*` + `utils/*` — never a component or the registry, so it's the clean headless lane.
- **`api/types`** — folded-thread + tool domain types (pure types).
- **`api/tools`** — **`toolRegistry`**, **`registerToolRenderers`** (the generic per-product seam, see §2),
  `lookupToolRenderer`, `GenericMcpToolRenderer`, `DataToolRow`, `ToolActivity`, `FilePath`, and the
  diff/exec helpers. Isolated here because importing it pulls the side-effectful registry chunk.

## 2. Coupling boundary — couples to tasks runs, never to Max

This surface **couples to the tasks run API by design** (`products/tasks/frontend/generated/api`): a task +
its run + the SSE stream together _are_ the agent-run surface. Importing the tasks run/stream/command API
from the stream and interaction logics is expected.

It must stay **free of the Max scene and conversation orchestration**. Do not import `scenes/max/*`,
`maxThreadLogic`, `maxContextLogic`, `MaxUIContext`, or the conversations API from anywhere under
`products/posthog_ai/frontend`. Max is a _consumer_ of this surface, not a dependency of it.

- `runStreamLogic` keys on a generic `streamKey` (conversation id for Max, run/task id for a task
  viewer). Keep it generic — no Max-specific branching.
- **Product-specific tool renderers live in the consuming product, not here — via the generic seam.**
  `api/tools` exposes `toolRegistry` and the convenience wrapper **`registerToolRenderers(entries)`**: the
  generic per-product mechanism for a product to plug in cards that display its own entities. A product
  registers from its own scene's entrypoint; the shared registry stays free of product imports. **Max is
  the first consumer of this pattern, not a special case** — its renderers (insights, dashboards,
  recordings, error-tracking issues, notebooks, query results) live in `scenes/max/messages/adapters` and
  call `registerToolRenderers` via `registerMaxToolRenderers` (imported once by the Max scene). The shared
  registry only knows the built-ins, the exec verbs, the question card, the generic MCP card, and the
  generic `EditDiffRenderer`. Surfaces without an adapter for a key (tasks, signals inbox) fall through to
  the generic card — by design.
- If Max needs something the surface doesn't express generically, **lift it to a generic prop/selector here
  and have Max adapt** — never special-case Max in this directory. Enforced by a grep gate:
  `grep -rE "scenes/max|maxThreadLogic|MaxUIContext" products/posthog_ai/frontend` must be empty.

## 3. Streaming architecture (`logics/runStreamLogic.ts`)

The heart of the surface:

- **SSE connection** — a `fetch` body reader pumped through `eventsource-parser`; a reconnect resumes after
  the last Redis stream id via `Last-Event-ID` (capped exponential backoff + cumulative cap).
- **Ordered, append-only `log` is the single source of truth** — every wire frame (plus a few synthetic
  client entries) is appended, never keyed or per-entry deduped.
- **Pure projection** `foldLogToThread(entries) → { threadItems, toolInvocations }`, memoized on `log`
  identity, derives the rendered thread.
- **Keyed by `streamKey`** so concurrent streams stay independent.

**Permissions:** parse (`parsePermissionRequestFrame`) → route (`policy/toolPolicy` auto-approves
built-ins + read-only PostHog `exec`, else surfaces a card) → answer (`respondToPermission`) → resolve (pins
the id so a reconnect replay can't re-surface it).

Supporting modules live in `policy/` (tool policy + permission/question utils) and `types/`
(`streamTypes` = folded thread shapes; `wireTypes` = ACP wire shapes + guards). Wire types are
loosely typed — guard at the parse boundary with runtime checks; never assume a field is present.

## 4. Conventions

- **Logic in the logic, never in a component.** Wire parsing, log folding, SSE handling, telemetry, and
  permission routing belong in `runStreamLogic` (or a `policy/` sibling). Components consume selectors
  and dispatch actions.
- **Keep UI runtime-agnostic.** Render components take plain props (`ThreadItem`, `ToolInvocation`,
  `PermissionRequestRecord`); they know nothing about langgraph vs sandbox or the conversation.
- **Atomic components.** One responsibility per component — small memoized leaf presenters keyed by the
  stable item `id`, not a giant inline switch.
- **Memoize — `threadItems` re-projects on every appended frame.** Wrap leaves in `React.memo`, derive with
  `useMemo`, wrap child callbacks in `useCallback`, and subscribe narrowly (select only what you render).
- **Keep the projection pure.** `foldLogToThread` is pure and deterministic; item ids stay stable across
  re-folds. Listeners fire only side effects, each with a fire-once guard, suppressed on `source: 'replay'`.
- **A tool card is two header lines plus an accordion — overflow goes in the accordion.** Every tool
  renderer wraps its content in `ToolActivity`, which exposes exactly two always-visible header lines:
  the `title` and the `subtitle` (the one salient input — a command, path, repo, branch). **Any other
  presentable information a tool produces — parsed output, commit/repo lists, file contents, diffs, raw
  text — must go in the collapsible `body`, never the always-visible `children`.** The body is the
  `Activity` accordion: it auto-expands while the tool runs and collapses once it completes, so the
  thread stays scannable (one or two lines per tool) and a reader expands only the cards they care about.
  Reserve `children` (always-visible) for genuinely interactive payloads that would be useless collapsed
  (e.g. the `AskUserQuestion` recap the user must act on) — not for output. When in doubt, it goes in the
  accordion.

```

## 6. Replacement-readiness

This surface is the intended replacement for Max's **legacy LangGraph thread**. The design keeps the
eventual switch clean, so build with it in mind:

- **The new-vs-legacy switch is a consumer concern, not this surface's.** Max already routes
  `conversation.agent_runtime === 'sandbox'` through `runStreamLogic` (keyed by `conversationId`) and renders
  `threadItems` via this surface, while its LangGraph `EventSource` path renders Max's own thread. **This
  surface must never branch on Max/LangGraph/conversation** — enforced by the §2 grep gate.
- **For full replacement, what the LangGraph path owns that the surface doesn't express generically** —
  agent modes, billing context, scene attachments/context — **stays in Max as a consumer** and feeds the
  surface through generic props / the tool registry / `streamKey`. If the surface needs it, lift it to a
  generic seam here; never special-case Max. The setting flips the default implementation **in Max**; this
  surface's contract (the four tiers in §1) is unchanged whichever side of the switch is active.
