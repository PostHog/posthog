# Managing path cleaning rules

Path cleaning rules normalize `$pathname` and `$entry_pathname` so that pages
sharing the same template (`/users/123/profile`, `/users/456/profile`, …) collapse
into one row (`/users/<id>/profile`) in Web analytics tiles, Paths insights, and
any HogQL query that calls `apply_path_cleaning`. They are the right answer when
a breakdown is fragmented across thousands of near-identical URLs.

This skill teaches you how to:

- recognize when path cleaning is the right tool
- inspect real paths to find what needs cleaning
- write `regex` + `alias` rules in re2 syntax with the project's placeholder
  convention
- test rules before saving them
- order rules so specific patterns aren't swallowed by generic ones
- apply the rules via MCP

## Data model

`Team.path_cleaning_filters` is a JSON list of `PathCleaningFilter` objects:

```json
{
  "regex": "/users/\\d+/profile",
  "alias": "/users/<id>/profile",
  "order": 0
}
```

- **`regex`** — a [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) pattern. No
  need to escape `/`. Anchor with `^` / `$` when you mean it.
- **`alias`** — the literal replacement. Use angle-bracket placeholders
  (`<id>`, `<slug>`, `<uuid>`, `<date>`) by convention so the cleaned path stays
  human-readable. The alias is _not_ a regex template — backreferences are not
  supported.
- **`order`** — integer. Rules apply **sequentially** in `order` ascending,
  each rule's output feeds the next.

Application is `replaceRegexpAll(pathname, regex, alias)` per rule, chained.

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm path cleaning is the right move

Ask yourself: is the user complaining about cardinality (too many distinct paths
in a chart), or do they want a per-URL drill-down? Path cleaning is for the
former. If they want per-URL data, suggest a property filter on `$pathname`
instead.

### 2. Inspect the real paths

Don't guess at patterns — query them. With the `execute-sql` MCP tool:

```sql
SELECT properties.$pathname AS path, count() AS views
FROM events
WHERE event = '$pageview'
  AND timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY path
ORDER BY views DESC
LIMIT 200
```

Scan the result for:

- numeric IDs: `/users/123`, `/orders/4242`
- UUIDs: `/sessions/8f3c1a3b-…`
- slugs: `/posts/why-i-love-posthog`
- dates: `/archive/2024-09-12`
- locales: `/en-US/`, `/fr-FR/`
- pagination: `?page=3`, `/page/3/`

### 3. Draft regex + alias

| Pattern             | Example match          | `regex`                      | `alias`                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Numeric segment     | `/users/123/profile`   | `/users/\d+/profile`         | `/users/<id>/profile`  |
| UUID v4             | `/sessions/8f3c1a3b-…` | `/sessions/[0-9a-f-]{36}`    | `/sessions/<uuid>`     |
| Slug                | `/posts/why-posthog`   | `/posts/[a-z0-9-]+$`         | `/posts/<slug>`        |
| ISO date            | `/archive/2024-09-12`  | `/archive/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` | `/archive/<date>`      |
| Locale prefix       | `/en-US/about`         | `^/[a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2}/`       | `/<locale>/`           |
| Trailing query/page | `/blog?page=3`         | `\?page=\d+$`                | (empty alias drops it) |

Anchoring rules of thumb:

- start the regex with `^` only when the segment must be at the beginning of
  the path
- end with `$` to keep a generic rule (e.g. `\d+$`) from matching mid-path
  segments

### 4. Test before saving

Three options, pick one:

- **Settings page tester**: `/settings/project#path_cleaning` has a built-in
  "test path" input that replays the full ordered chain.
- **Project HogQL** (via `execute-sql`):

  ```sql
  SELECT replaceRegexpAll('/users/42/profile', '/users/\d+/profile', '/users/<id>/profile')
  ```

  Chain `replaceRegexpAll` calls in the same order the rules will run if you
  want to verify multi-rule interaction.

- **Built-in AI helper**: there is already an `AiRegexHelper` modal accessible
  from the rule editor (`Help me with Regex` button) that turns natural
  language into a regex. Suggest it to the user when they say "I don't know
  regex" — but always validate the output against real paths via the tester.

### 5. Order rules from most-specific to most-general

Sequential application means a generic rule placed first will swallow
everything that should have hit a specific rule.

```text
order=0  /users/me/profile        →  /users/me/profile     (specific, runs first)
order=1  /users/\d+/profile       →  /users/<id>/profile
order=2  /users/[a-z0-9-]+        →  /users/<slug>          (catch-all, runs last)
```

If `/users/[a-z0-9-]+` ran first it would also match `/users/me/profile` and
make the more specific rule unreachable.

### 6. Apply via MCP

Use the `project-settings-update` tool with the full list (the field is
replaced, not merged):

```json
{
  "path_cleaning_filters": [
    { "regex": "/users/me/profile", "alias": "/users/me/profile", "order": 0 },
    { "regex": "/users/\\d+/profile", "alias": "/users/<id>/profile", "order": 1 },
    { "regex": "/users/[a-z0-9-]+", "alias": "/users/<slug>", "order": 2 }
  ]
}
```

Always **read the existing rules first** (project settings include
`path_cleaning_filters`) and merge — overwriting silently destroys whatever the
team has already configured.

## Where the rules apply

When the user (or a HogQL query) opts in:

- Web analytics: the **Path cleaning** toggle in the page header
  (`PathCleaningToggle.tsx`)
- Paths insights: the path cleaning toggle in the insight filters
- HogQL: any query that calls `apply_path_cleaning(path_expr, team)`

The rules are stored once per project — they are not insight-scoped.

## Common pitfalls

- **No backreferences in `alias`** — `\1` will be inserted literally. To keep
  parts of the path, write a regex that only matches the dynamic segment and
  let the surrounding path pass through unchanged.
- **Forgetting `$`** — `\d+` without an end anchor matches the first numeric
  segment of any path, so `/blog/2024/post` becomes `/blog/<num>4/post`. Use
  `\d+$` or `\d+(/|$)` depending on intent.
- **Escaping `/`** — re2 does not require it. `\/` works but adds noise.
- **Case sensitivity** — re2 is case-sensitive by default. Use `(?i)` at the
  start of the pattern for case-insensitive matching, e.g. `(?i)/users/\d+`.
- **Replacing the whole list** — `path_cleaning_filters` is overwrite, not
  append. Always start from the current list.
- **Rules apply globally** — adding a rule can change historical numbers in
  every Web analytics / Paths chart that has cleaning enabled. Warn the user
  before applying anything destructive.
