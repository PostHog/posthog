"""
Data and error types that cross the managed_warehouse boundary.

Pure Python — no Django, no DRF, no duckdb — so consumers can import these without
dragging the product's runtime onto their import path. The product's internals import
them from here too, so there is exactly one definition of each.

These stay plain ``dataclass`` rather than ``pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass``: they
carry query results on a hot path, and per-row validation on construction would be a
behavior change, not a contract improvement.
