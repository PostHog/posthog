"""
Contract types for apm.

Frozen dataclasses that define what this product exposes.
No Django imports. Used by facade as inputs/outputs.

Uses ``pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass`` rather than the stdlib
variant — same syntax, same ``is_dataclass()`` compatibility (so
``DataclassSerializer`` keeps working), but with runtime type
validation on construction.
