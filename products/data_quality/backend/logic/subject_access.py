"""Which check subjects the caller may not read.

The REST endpoint and the ``information_schema.data_quality_*`` tables must never disagree on
visibility, so both resolve denial from the same source: the warehouse-table denial the HogQL
database computes for the caller. A member denied a table or view must not read its checks, run
history, or health rollup -- those carry the compiled ``config``, failed-row counts, and observed
values, which together act as a count oracle over rows the member cannot read directly.
