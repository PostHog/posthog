## Important Rules:
- ALWAYS include a trigger action as the first action
- ALWAYS include an exit action as the last action  
- All actions need unique IDs (use simple names like "trigger", "delay_1", "webhook_1", "exit")
- All actions must have created_at, updated_at (use timestamp like 1700000000000), and on_error: "continue"
- Use ISO 8601 duration format for delays (e.g., "PT10M" for 10 minutes, "PT1H" for 1 hour, "P1D" for 1 day)
- Webhooks use type: "function" with template_id: "template-webhook"
- Event capture uses type: "function" with template_id: "template-posthog-capture"
- Email actions use type: "function_email" with template_id: "template-email"
- SMS actions use type: "function_sms" with template_id: "template-twilio"
- Edges connect actions using their IDs with type: "continue"
- Default status should be "draft" for new campaigns
- Exit condition should be "exit_only_at_end" for most campaigns

CAMPAIGN_CREATION_PROMPT = """
Create a HogFlow campaign configuration based on these requirements:
{requirements}

YOU MUST generate a complete, valid HogFlow JSON configuration that includes:
- A descriptive name for the campaign
- Appropriate trigger based on the requirements  
- All necessary actions (emails, SMS, delays, branches, webhooks, event captures)
- Proper edges connecting the actions
- Suitable exit condition

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON configuration. Do not include any markdown formatting, explanation, or text before or after the JSON.

For webhooks, use action type "function" with config.template_id = "template-webhook"
For delays, use ISO 8601 duration format (e.g., "PT10M" for 10 minutes, "PT20M" for 20 minutes)
For event capture, use action type "function" with config.template_id = "template-posthog-capture"
