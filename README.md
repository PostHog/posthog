## PostHog is an all-in-one, open source platform for building successful products

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) provides every tool you need to build a successful product including:

- [Product analytics](https://posthog.com/product-analytics): Autocapture or manually instrument event-based analytics to understand user behavior and analyze data with visualization or SQL.
- [Web analytics](https://posthog.com/web-analytics): Monitor web traffic and user sessions with a GA-like dashboard. Easily monitor conversion, web vitals, and revenue.
- [Session replays](https://posthog.com/session-replay): Watch real user sessions of interactions with your website or mobile app to diagnose issues and understand user behavior.
- [Feature flags](https://posthog.com/feature-flags): Safely roll out features to select users or cohorts with feature flags.
- [Experiments](https://posthog.com/experiments): Test changes and measure their statistical impact on goal metrics. Set up experiments with no-code too.
- [Error tracking](https://posthog.com/error-tracking): Track errors, get alerts, and resolve issues to improve your product.
- [Surveys](https://posthog.com/surveys): Ask anything with our collection of no-code survey templates, or build custom surveys with our survey builder.
- [Data warehouse](https://posthog.com/data-warehouse): Sync data from external tools like Stripe, Hubspot, your data warehouse, and more. Query it alongside your product data.
- [Data pipelines](https://posthog.com/cdp): Run custom filters and transformations on your incoming data. Send it to 25+ tools or any webhook in real time or batch export large amounts to your warehouse.
- [LLM observability](https://posthog.com/docs/ai-engineering): Capture traces, generations, latency, and cost for your LLM-powered app.

Best of all, all of this is free to use with a [generous monthly free tier](https://posthog.com/pricing) for each product. Get started by signing up for [PostHog Cloud US](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup).

## Getting started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is signing up for free toÂ [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 250 survey responses are free every month, after which you pay based on usage.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

If you want to self-host PostHog, you can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 4GB memory):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend [migrating to a PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).

We _do not_ provide customer support or offer guarantees for open source deployments. See our [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more info.
