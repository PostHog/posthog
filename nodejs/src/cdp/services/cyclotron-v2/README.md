# Cyclotron (Node)

TypeScript job queue backed by PostgreSQL, using `pg` directly.

## Schema

Lives in a **separate database** (`cyclotron_node`) with its own migrations
in `rust/cyclotron-node-migrations/`.
Run them with `rust/bin/migrate-cyclotron-node`.

Single table `cyclotron_jobs` with a single `state` BYTEA column
for all job payload data (mirrors how the Kafka backend serializes everything into one blob).

## Components

### Manager (producer)

Creates jobs via `createJob()` / `bulkCreateJobs()`.
The bulk path uses `UNNEST` for efficient batch inserts.

### Worker (consumer)

Poll-based consumer using `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to dequeue batches.
Each dequeued job exposes an ack interface:

- `ack()` — mark completed
- `fail()` — mark failed
- `retry({ delayMs?, state? })` — re-queue with optional delay and updated state
- `cancel()` — mark canceled
- `heartbeat()` — extend the lock to prevent the janitor from reclaiming the job

## Integration

The `CyclotronJobQueuePostgresV2` wrapper in `job-queue/` bridges this SDK with the existing
`CyclotronJobInvocation` types used by CDP consumers.
It's enabled via `CDP_CYCLOTRON_NODE_ENABLED=true` and routed alongside the existing backends
(kafka, delay) in `CyclotronJobQueue`.

## No DLQ

Failed jobs are deleted by the janitor along with completed and canceled jobs.
There is no dead-letter queue — a DLQ would fill the database exponentially
since failed jobs often produce more failed jobs on retry.
Errors are captured via logs and metrics before the job reaches terminal status.

## Future work

- **Activity table** —
  a separate table to store a high-level record of all run activities.
  Jobs are ephemeral (deleted after completion),
  so a durable activity log would give visibility into historical runs
  without keeping the jobs table unbounded.
- **`action_id` column for workflows** —
  an additional indexed column so scheduled workflow actions
  can be queried and displayed more effectively
  (e.g. "show me all pending actions for this workflow step").
- **Cancellation API** —
  API tooling to cancel scheduled jobs by query
  (e.g. by `function_id`, `parent_run_id`, or `action_id`).
  Especially useful for workflows where a user cancels a run
  and all its pending scheduled jobs need to be cleaned up.
