# This management command is intended to be used to migrate data from one Kafka
# cluster to another. It is intended for the use case where the Kafka cluster
# has suffered some catastrophic failure that causes us to migrate to a new
# cluster. The old cluster may well come back up, and in which case we would
# want to ensure that if there is any data in the old cluster that wasn't
# consumed by the PostHog app when it was pointing at it, then that data is
# transferred to the new cluster.
#
# We do not make any attempt at validation, so it's important to ensure that you
# move data to and from the corresponding topics.
#
# We also do not validate that you use the correct consumer group ID, so it's
# important that you use the same consumer group ID that the PostHog app is
# using when consuming from the old cluster, otherwise you risk migrating data
# that has already been consumed.
#
# By default the target Kafka cluster is the currently configured cluster in
# Django settings.
