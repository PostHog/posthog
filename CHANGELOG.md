![inspect](https://posthog.com/images/3ce1232ef29d0d59b4ac2779d8e97cf8/inspect.gif)

![heatmap](https://posthog.com/images/782d9d2142c331403efdbec7ebd56145/heatmap.gif)

![toolbar dance](https://posthog.com/images/55fe4bbc5e8fbc428fe4f1830f3d280c/dance.gif)

#### Feature flags

- Feature flags let you roll out changes to users with a certain property, or to a percentage of users, or some combo of the two.

![feature flags](https://posthog.com/static/2824e49b2d3200ba4260a1bb83edb6ad/db910/feature-flags.png)

#### Other exciting, enthralling and invigorating features

- Flutter Integration. You asked for it and now [it's here](https://posthog.com/docs/integrations/flutter-integration)!
- Retention page. PostHog already had stickiness, but now there is a table that demonstrates perhaps more clearly how your users are coming back (or not!)

![retention view](https://posthog.com/static/c72806fa990efb5ea9bcf852c9ba9ffe/dc333/retention-view.png)

- Better onboarding. We've had a go at redoing how our set up flow works, and will be tracking if it helps more people get through PostHog's own funnel!
- Platform.sh deployment. A very simple, new and trendy way to get up and running!
- Porter development. Join the cool kids and do  web development in the cloud. Thank you so much to [porter-dev](https://github.com/porter-dev) for creating this PR.
- Event name filtering. By popular demand, you can now filter the events table by the event name. Happy debugging your implementations!

![filter by event name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1727427/84702990-c7f59f00-af57-11ea-8455-92fb89d9c9ae.png)

![sessions more detail](https://posthog.com/static/c4fe51ff11bbe87eb64c00daf7cc3d78/efc66/session-broken-out.png)

* [Django upgraded to 3.0.7](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/932)
* We [made HTTPS work locally](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/910) - we had lots of community issues raised, so that should make it easier to get started with!

### 1.1.0 - Wednesday 15 April 2020

Important! We've added Celery workers. We'll move tasks to workers to speed up a lot of actions in PostHog. [See update instructions](https://posthog.com/docs/deployment/upgrading-posthog#upgrading-from-before-1011) on how to enable workers.

- Users can integrate PostHog with Slack to send push notifications when events are triggered

- Funnels can now be filtered by Events not just Actions
- Funnels can be filtered by time intervals as well
