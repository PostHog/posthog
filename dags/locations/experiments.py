EXPERIMENTS LOCATION FILE

This module organizes experiment assets into a complete Dagster location.
It takes the individual assets defined in experiments.py and bundles them
with shared resources to create a complete Dagster definitions object.

Structure:
- experiments.py: Creates individual assets and jobs
- locations/experiments.py: Bundles everything with resources
- Dagster: Imports this location and integrates with other locations

Key concepts:
- Assets: Individual data products (experiment-metric analyses)
- Jobs: Collections of assets that run together
- Schedules: Automatic triggers for jobs
- Resources: Shared infrastructure (databases, storage, etc.)
- Definitions: Complete package that Dagster can load

# Integration notes
# =============================================================================
#
# This location integrates with the broader Dagster system as follows:
#
# 1. Dagster discovers this file through workspace.yaml configuration
# 2. Dagster imports the 'defs' variable from this module
# 3. Dagster combines definitions from all locations into one unified system
# 4. Users interact with assets through the Dagster UI or API
#
# Data flow:
# Database ‚Üí experiments.py ‚Üí locations/experiments.py ‚Üí Dagster UI
