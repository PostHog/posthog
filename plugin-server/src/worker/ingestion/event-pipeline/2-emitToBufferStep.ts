/** Returns whether the event should be delayed using the event buffer mechanism.
 *
 * Why? Non-anonymous not merging events with no existing person matching their distinct ID are sent to a buffer.
 * This is so that we can better handle the case where one client uses a fresh distinct ID before another client
 * has managed to send the $identify event aliasing an existing anonymous distinct ID to the fresh distinct ID.
 *
 * This is easier to see with an example scenario:
 * 1. User visits signup page,
 *    in turn frontend captures anonymous `$pageview` for distinct ID `XYZ` (anonymous distinct ID = device ID).
 *    This event gets person ID A.
 * 2. User click signup button, initiating in a backend request,
 *    in turn frontend captures anonymous `$autocapture` (click) for distinct ID `XYZ`.
 *    This event gets person ID A.
 * 3. Signup request is processed in the backend,
 *    in turn backend captures identified `signup` for distinct ID `alice@example.com`.
 *    OOPS! We haven't seen `alice@example.com` before, so this event gets person ID B.
 * 4. Signup request finishes successfully,
 *    in turn frontend captures identified `$identify` aliasing distinct ID `XYZ` to `alice@example.com`.
 *    This event gets person ID A.
 *
 * Without a buffer, the event from step 3 gets a new person ID, which messes up analysis by unique users.
 * By delaying the event from step 3, all events get the desired person ID A.
