/**
 * - A note on Kafka partitioning
 *
 * We are ingesting events and partitioning based on session_id. This means that we can have multiple sessions
 * going to one partition, but for any given ID they should land all on the same partition.
 *
 * As we want to buffer events before writing them to S3, we don't auto-commit our kafka consumer offsets.
 * Instead, we track all offsets that are "in-flight" and when we flush a buffer to S3 we remove these in-flight offsets
 * and write the oldest offset to Kafka. This allows us to resume from the oldest offset in the case of a consumer
 * restart or rebalance, even if some of the following offsets have already been written to S3.
 *
 * The other trick is when a rebalance occurs we need to remove all in-flight sessions for partitions that are no longer
 * assigned to us.
 *
 * This all works based on the idea that there is only one consumer (Orchestrator) per partition, allowing us to
 * track everything in this single process
