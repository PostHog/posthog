# Timestamp Parser Plugin

Parse event timestamps into:

-   Day of the week
-   Day of the month
-   Month
-   Year
-   Hour
-   Minute


So you can explore questions like:

-   Do we get more purchases on weekdays or weekends?
-   Why does our traffic spike on Tuesdays?
-   How do users use our platform differently during the holiday season?
