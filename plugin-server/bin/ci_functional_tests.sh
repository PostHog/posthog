# Script for running the functional tests in CI, outputting an Istambul coverage
# report. When running the intetgration tests locally, it's probably better to
# simply run `yarn functional_tests` directly which will allow e.g. to watch for
# changes. This script is intended to handle the complexities of spinning up the
# plugin server with the appropriate environment vars setup, and ensuring we
# bring down the server such that c8 produces the coverage report.
# Context is this was originally written in the GitHub Actions workflow file,
# but it's easier to debug in a script.
