          Background calculation can be tracked using the `query_status` response field.

          Whether to refresh the insight, how aggresively, and if sync or async:
          - `'force_cache'` - return cached data or a cache miss; always completes immediately as it never calculates
          - `'blocking'` - calculate synchronously (returning only when the query is done), UNLESS there are very fresh results in the cache
          - `'async'` - kick off background calculation (returning immediately with a query status), UNLESS there are very fresh results in the cache
          - `'lazy_async'` - kick off background calculation, UNLESS there are somewhat fresh results in the cache
          - `'force_blocking'` - calculate synchronously, even if fresh results are already cached
          - `'force_async'` - kick off background calculation, even if fresh results are already cached
          Background calculation can be tracked using the `query_status` response field.

                Like `ProjectBasicSerializer`, but also works as a drop-in replacement for `TeamBasicSerializer` by way of
                passthrough fields. This allows the meaning of `Team` to change from "project" to "environment" without breaking
                backward compatibility of the REST API.

                Like `ProjectBasicSerializer`, but also works as a drop-in replacement for `TeamBasicSerializer` by way of
                passthrough fields. This allows the meaning of `Team` to change from "project" to "environment" without breaking
                backward compatibility of the REST API.

                Like `ProjectBasicSerializer`, but also works as a drop-in replacement for `TeamBasicSerializer` by way of
                passthrough fields. This allows the meaning of `Team` to change from "project" to "environment" without breaking
                backward compatibility of the REST API.

             You can use a simplified version:
            ```json
            {
                "properties": [
                    {
                        "key": "email",
                        "value": "x@y.com",
                        "operator": "exact",
                        "type": "event"
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```

            Or you can create more complicated queries with AND and OR:
            ```json
            {
                "properties": {
                    "type": "AND",
                    "values": [
                        {
                            "type": "OR",
                            "values": [
                                {"key": "email", ...},
                                {"key": "email", ...}
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "AND",
                            "values": [
                                {"key": "email", ...},
                                {"key": "email", ...}
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                ]
            }
            ```
