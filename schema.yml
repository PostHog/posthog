    version: null
    description: "\nThis section of our Docs explains how to pull or push data from/to\
        \ our API. PostHog has an API available on all tiers of PostHog cloud pricing,\
        \ including the free tier, and for every self-hosted version.\n\nPlease note that\
        \ PostHog makes use of two different APIs, serving different purposes and using\
        \ different mechanisms for authentication.\n\nOne API is used for pushing data\
        \ into PostHog. This uses the 'Team API Key' that is included in the [frontend\
        \ snippet](/docs/integrate/client/js). This API Key is **public**, and is what\
        \ we use in our frontend integration to push events into PostHog, as well as to\
        \ check for feature flags, for instance.\n\nThe other API is more powerful and\
        \ allows you to perform any action as if you were an authenticated user utilizing\
        \ the PostHog UI. It is mostly used for getting data out of PostHog, as well as\
        \ other private actions such as creating a feature flag. This uses a 'Personal\
        \ API Key' which you need to create manually (instructions [below](#authentication)).\
        \ This API Key is **private** and you should not make it public nor share it with\
        \ anyone. It gives you access to all the data held by your PostHog instance, which\
        \ includes sensitive information.\n\nThese API Docs refer mostly to the **private\
        \ API**, performing authentication as outlined below. The only exception is the\
        \ [POST-only public endpoints](/docs/api/post-only-endpoints) section. This section\
        \ explicitly informs you on how to perform authentication. For endpoints in all\
        \ other sections, authentication is done as described below.\n\n## Authentication\n\
        \nPersonal API keys allow full access to your account, just like e-mail address\
        \ and password, but you can create any number of them and each one can invalidated\
        \ individually at any moment. This makes for greater control for you and improved\
        \ security of stored data.\n\n### How to obtain a personal API key\n\n1. Click\
        \ on your name/avatar on the top right.\n1. Click on 'My account'\n1. Navigate\
        \ to the 'Personal API Keys' section.\n1. Click \"+ Create a Personal API Key\"\
        .\n1. Give your new key a label – it's just for you, usually to describe the key's\
        \ purpose.\n1. Click 'Create Key'.\n1. There you go! At the top of the list you\
        \ should now be seeing your brand new key. **Immediately** copy its value, as\
        \ you'll **never** see it again after refreshing the page. But don't worry if\
        \ you forget to copy it – you can delete and create keys as much as you want.\n\
        \n### How to use a personal API key\n\nThere are three options:\n\n1. Use the\
        \ `Authorization` header and `Bearer` authentication, like so:\n    ```JavaScript\n\
        \    const headers = {\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}`\n\
        \    }\n    ```\n2. Put the key in request body, like so:\n    ```JavaScript\n\
        \    const body = {\n        personal_api_key: POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY\n    }\n\
        \    ```\n3. Put the key in query string, like so:\n    ```JavaScript\n    const\
        \ url = `https://posthog.example.com/api/event/?personal_api_key=${POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}`\n\
        \    ```\n\nAny one of these methods works, but only the value encountered first\
        \ (in the order above) will be used for authenticaition!\n\nFor PostHog Cloud,\
        \ use `app.posthog.com` as the host address.\n\n#### Specifying a project when\
        \ using the API\n\nBy default, if you're accessing the API, PostHog will return\
        \ results from the last project you visited in the UI. To override this behavior,\
        \ you can pass in your Project API Key (public token) as a query parameter in\
        \ the request. This ensures you will get data from the project associated with\
        \ that token.\n\n**Example**\n\n```\napi/event/?token=my_project_api_key\n```\n\
        \n### cURL example for self-hosted PostHog\n\n```bash\nPOSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY=qTjsppKJqYLr2YskbsLXmu46eW1oH0r3jZkmKaERlf0\n\
        \ncurl --header \"Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY\" https://posthog.example.com/api/person/\n\
        ```\n\n### cURL example for PostHog Cloud\n\n```bash\nPOSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY=qTjsppKJqYLr2YskbsLXmu46eW1oH0r3jZkmKaERlf0\n\
        curl --header \"Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY\" https://app.posthog.com/api/person/\n\
        ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- The [`/users/@me/` endpoint](/docs/api/user) gives you useful\
        \ information about the current user.\n- The `/api/event_definition/` and `/api/property_definition`\
        \ endpoints provide the possible event names and properties you can use throughout\
        \ the rest of the API.\n- The maximum size of a POST request body is governed\
        \ by `settings.DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`, and is 20MB by default.\n\n## Pagination\n\
        \nSometimes requests are paginated. If that's the case, it'll be in the following\
        \ format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"next\": \"https://posthog.example.com/api/person/?cursor=cD0yMjgxOTA2\"\
        ,\n    \"previous\": null,\n    \"results\": [\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n\
        You can then just call the `\"next\"` URL to get the next set of results.\n\n\
