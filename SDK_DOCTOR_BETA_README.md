# SDK Doctor Beta README
(soon to be replaced by actual docs)

### Current SDK Doctor functionality ðŸ©º

#### Detects outdated versions of 12 PostHog SDKs
- Adds a button to the righthand sidebar if outdated SDKs detected in recent events
- **12 PostHog SDKs supported**: Web, Python, React Native, Node.js, Flutter, iOS, Android, Go, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Elixir
- **Indicators for outdatedness**: ðŸŸ¢ Current, ðŸŸ¡ Close enough, and ðŸ”´ Outdated
- **Links to docs**: Display links to SDK changelogs and documentation pages
- **Alert thresholds by device type**: 
  Desktop/web events trigger alerts when SDKs are 3+ releases behind *and* 48+ hours old. 
  Mobile app events only alert for versions >8 weeks old (to reduce noise from slower rollout cycles)
- **Selective annoyance** - The SDK Doctor button is only added to the righthand sidebar for `Outdated` versions (3 or more releases old, 48+ hours old.) Otherwise, SDK Doctor is only available via the menu in the lower right corner when SDKs are `Current` or `Close enough`
- **Volume-adaptive event scanning**: Automatically adjusts the number of events sampled, based on customer volume. Scans occur at session start, with autoscans every 30 minutes thereafter. On-demand scan is available via menu
- **Server-side caching**: GitHub release version and release date info is cached server-side for 6 hours (for speed, and to avoid rate-limiting)

#### Detect Feature Flags called too soon
- **Too soon**: Catches `Feature flag called` events captured before any other events in the session and displays an alert in the righthand sidebar
- **Bootstrapping detection**: Does not show alerts for bootstrapped flags
- **Example event links**: Provides links to the first feature flag called event detected, to help with debugging
- **Links to docs**: Shows links to bootstrapping doc and `onFeatureFlags` doc
- Handles multiple flags at once
- Auto-clears alert after proper flag usage patterns detected

## Post-beta

### Detect multiple SDK init attempts
- Alert when we detect attempts to initialize the same SDK multiple times on the same page in the same session

#### Under consideration for post-beta:
- Add a `Do not notify me about this again for...` option
- Add Max for add'l help
- Detect when a feature flag uses a cohort which relies on another cohort which has since been deleted (until/unless that functionality gets added to cohorts)
- Use `Teams` activity history to look for issues, e.g. [this thread](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C03PB072FMJ/p1754557639664509)
- Add a backend tool behind a FF for CS folks to view a list of their accounts who have out-of date SDK versions
- Relay outdated SDK information to HogHero for more support context
