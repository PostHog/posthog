Description: This stack deploys a Fargate cluster that is in a VPC with both
             public and private subnets. Containers can be deployed into either
             the public subnets or the private subnets, and there are two load
             balancers. One is inside the public subnet, which can be used to
             send traffic to the containers in the private subnet, and one in
             the private subnet, which can be used for private internal traffic
             between internal services. Specificaly for Posthog <3
Parameters:
  StackName:
    Type: String
    Default: posthog

Mappings:
  # Hard values for the subnet masks. These masks define
  # the range of internal IP addresses that can be assigned.
  # The VPC can have all IP's from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
  # There are four subnets which cover the ranges:
  #
  # 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255
  # 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255
  # 10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255
  # 10.0.3.0 - 10.0.3.255
  #
  # If you need more IP addresses (perhaps you have so many
  # instances that you run out) then you can customize these
  # ranges to add more
