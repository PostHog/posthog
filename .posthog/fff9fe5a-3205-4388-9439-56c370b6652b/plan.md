I'll help you understand the error referenced by that ID. Let me search for it in the codebase.
The error ID isn't found in the codebase, which suggests this might be:

1. A runtime error ID from logs or monitoring systems
2. A UUID from an error tracking service
3. An error from a different context that needs to be provided

Let me search for common error patterns and error handling in the codebase to understand the context better:
Let me check if this might be related to the PostHog tasks/agent system, since the `@` prefix suggests it might be a reference to something:
Let me check the task models and API to understand if this ID format is used for task errors:
Now let me check if there's any reference to this type of error ID format in the error tracking product:
Let me check the error tracking models to see if that ID format is used:
The error ID `@0199dfe5-fa1f-7973-a22f-5f87fba9ff9a` appears to be a reference format (with the `@` prefix) that might be used in the context of the PostHog codebase. Let me search for how this `@` prefix is used:
Based on my research, I cannot find the specific error ID `@0199dfe5-fa1f-7973-a22f-5f87fba9ff9a` anywhere in the PostHog codebase. However, I can provide you with comprehensive information about what this format likely represents and what could cause errors with this type of identifier.
I've completed my analysis of the error ID `@0199dfe5-fa1f-7973-a22f-5f87fba9ff9a`. Here's what I found:

## Summary

The error ID **is not found in the PostHog source code**, which means it's a **runtime-generated identifier**. The `@` prefix followed by a UUID is a common pattern in PostHog for referencing specific database records or tracking execution state.

## What This Error ID Likely Represents

Based on the codebase structure, this UUID could be:

1. **TaskProgress Error ID** - A failed task execution record in the tasks system
2. **ErrorTracking Issue ID** - An error tracking issue UUID
3. **Temporal Workflow ID** - An identifier from the Temporal workflow system
4. **External Reference** - An ID from a monitoring/logging system

## Common Error Sources

### 1. Task Execution Failures

Location: `products/tasks/backend/models.py` (TaskProgress model)

**Common causes:**

- Sandbox provisioning failures
- Repository clone/access issues
- GitHub integration problems
- Claude Code execution timeouts
- Missing API keys or credentials
- Workflow activity failures

### 2. Error Tracking Issues

Location: `posthog/models/error_tracking/error_tracking.py`

**Common causes:**

- Issue not found (deleted or wrong team)
- Fingerprint override conflicts
- Merge/split operation failures

### 3. Temporal Workflow Errors

Location: `products/tasks/backend/temporal/`

**Common causes:**

- Workflow timeout exceeded
- Activity heartbeat failures
- Non-retryable application errors
- Sandbox environment issues

## How to Investigate

To understand what this specific error is, you would need to:

1. **Query the database** for this UUID in tables like:
    - `posthog_task_progress` (task execution errors)
    - `posthog_errortrackingissue` (error tracking)
    - `posthog_task` (task records)

2. **Check application logs** for this ID:
    - Temporal workflow logs
    - Django backend logs
    - Sandbox execution logs

3. **Review the context** where you encountered this error:
    - Browser console errors
    - API response details
    - Network request failures

## Questions to Help Diagnose

Could you provide more context about:

- **Where did you see this error?** (UI, logs, API response, etc.)
- **What were you doing?** (viewing an error tracking issue, running a task, etc.)
- **What is the full error message?** (not just the ID)
- **Any accompanying error details or stack traces?**

This additional information would help narrow down the specific cause and provide more targeted guidance.
