<p>
  There's been a fatal error with your batch export {{ name }} at {{ time }}. Due to the nature of the error, we could not automatically recover from the failure and it requires manual intervention.

  We recommend reviewing the batch export logs for error details:
</p>

<div class="mb mt text-center">
  <a href="{% absolute_uri '/project' %}/{{ team.id }}/batch_exports/{{ id }}"
     target="_blank"><b>Go to the batch export</b></a>
</div>

<p>
  In the logs you may find configuration errors that can be addressed by yourself, like an incorrect credential, or an unreachable warehouse. If youâ€™re feeling extra-adventurous, sometimes a manual retry can fix things!

  If you can't diagnose the issue, please contact us for help. Keep in mind that if the batch export continues to fail we will have to disable it.
