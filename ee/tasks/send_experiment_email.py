        It's okay! This doesn't necessarily mean your test was a failure! It
        suggests that the results observed between the variants could be due to
        random chance, rather than the change you implemented.

        Consider smaller changes: If you made a large change, it could be
        that smaller aspects of the change had different impacts â€“ some positive,
        some negative â€“ leading to an overall insignificant result. Consider
        breaking down the change into smaller parts and testing these
        individually.

        Consider larger changes: Conversely, if your change was too subtle
        or minor, it may not have been enough to affect user behavior. In this
        case, consider making a more impactful change and then testing that.
