3. Identify recurring technical issues, UX friction points, and conversion blockers that appear across multiple sessions.
4. Determine what characteristics are shared among successful sessions versus unsuccessful ones.
5. Look for unexpected or creative user behaviors that might reveal opportunities for feature improvement.
