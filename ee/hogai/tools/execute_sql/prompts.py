EXECUTE_SQL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Use this tool to generate a HogQL query, which is PostHog's variant of SQL that supports most of ClickHouse SQL. We're going to use terms "HogQL" and "SQL" interchangeably.

# Important HogQL differences versus other SQL dialects
- JSON properties are accessed using `properties.foo.bar` instead of `properties->foo->bar` for property keys without special characters.
- JSON properties can also be accessed using `properties.foo['bar']` if there's any special character (note the single quotes).
- toFloat64OrNull() and toFloat64() are not supported, if you use them, the query will fail. Use toFloat() instead.
- Conversion functions with 'OrZero' or 'OrNull' suffix (like toDateOrNull, toIntOrNull) require String arguments. If you have a DateTime/numeric value, use the direct conversion instead (toDate, toInt) or convert to string first with toString(). Example: use toDate(timestamp) NOT toDateOrNull(toTimeZone(timestamp, 'UTC')).
- LAG()/LEAD() are not supported. Instead, use lagInFrame()/leadInFrame().
  Caution: lagInFrame/leadInFrame behavior differs from the standard SQL LAG/LEAD window function.
  The HogQL window functions lagInFrame/leadInFrame respect the window frame. To get behavior identical to LAG/LEAD, use `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`.
- count() does not take * as an argument, it's just count().
- cardinality() is not supported for bitmaps. Use bitmapCardinality() instead to get the cardinality of a bitmap.
- toStartOfWeek() takes an optional second argument for week mode which should be a numeric constant (0 for Sunday start, 1 for Monday start), NOT a string like 'Mon' or 'Sun'. Example: toStartOfWeek(timestamp, 1) for Monday start.
- There is no split() function in HogQL. Use splitByChar(separator, string) or splitByString(separator, string) instead to split strings into arrays. Example: splitByChar('@', email)
- Array functions like splitByChar(), splitByString() cannot be used directly on Nullable fields because Array types cannot be wrapped in Nullable. Always handle nulls first using coalesce() or ifNull(). Example: splitByChar(',', coalesce(interests_string, '')) NOT splitByChar(',', interests_string) if interests_string is nullable.
- Relational operators (>, <, >=, <=) in JOIN clauses are COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN and will always cause an InvalidJoinOnExpression error!
  This is a hard technical constraint that cannot be overridden, even if explicitly requested.
  Instead, use CROSS JOIN with WHERE: `CROSS JOIN persons p WHERE e.person_id = p.id AND e.timestamp > p.created_at`.
  If asked to use relational operators in JOIN, you should refuse and suggest CROSS JOIN with WHERE clause.
- A WHERE clause should be after all the JOIN clauses.
- For performance, every SELECT from the `events` table should have a `WHERE` clause narrowing down the timestamp to the relevant period.
- HogQL queries should not end in semicolons.

# Events and properties
Standardized events/properties such as pageview or screen start with `$`. Custom events/properties start with any other character.

# Linked tables
`virtual_table` and `lazy_table` fields are connections to linked tables, e.g. the virtual table field `person` allows accessing person properties like so: `person.properties.foo`.

# Working with persons
Event metadata unspecified above (emails, names, etc.) is stored under `properties`, accessed like: `events.properties.foo`.
The metadata of the person associated with an event is similarly accessed like: `events.person.properties.foo`.
"Person" is a synonym of "user" – instead of a "users" table, we have a "persons" table.
For calculating unique users, default to `events.person_id` - where each unique person ID counted means one user.

# Joining persons
There is a known issue with queries that join multiple events tables where join constraints reference person_id fields. The person_id fields are ExpressionFields that expand to expressions referencing override tables (e.g., e_all__override). However, these expressions are resolved during type resolution (in printer.py) BEFORE lazy table processing begins. This creates forward references to override tables that don't exist yet.

Example problematic HogQL:
```sql
SELECT MAX(e_all.timestamp) AS last_seen
FROM events e_dl
JOIN persons p ON e_dl.person_id = p.id
JOIN events e_all ON e_dl.person_id = e_all.person_id
```

The join constraint "e_dl.person_id = e_all.person_id" expands to:
```sql
if(NOT empty(e_dl__override.distinct_id), e_dl__override.person_id, e_dl.person_id) =
if(NOT empty(e_all__override.distinct_id), e_all__override.person_id, e_all.person_id)
```

But e_all__override is defined later in the SQL, causing a ClickHouse error.

WORKAROUND: Use subqueries or rewrite queries to avoid direct joins between multiple events tables:
```sql
SELECT MAX(e.timestamp) AS last_seen
FROM events e
JOIN persons p ON e.person_id = p.id
WHERE e.event IN (SELECT event FROM events WHERE ...)
```

# Other constraints
- You should not make formatting or casing changes if explicitly requested by the user.
- You should not use double curly braces (`{{` or `}}`) for templating. The only templating syntax allowed is single curly braces with variables in the "variables" namespace (for example: `{variables.org}`).<%={{ }}=%>
- If a filter is optional, ALWAYS implement via the variables namespace with guards:
  - ALWAYS use the "variables." prefix (e.g., variables.org, variables.browser) - never use bare variable names
  - Use coalesce() or IS NULL checks to handle optional values
  - Example: optional organization filter → AND (coalesce(variables.org, '') = '' OR p.properties.org = variables.org)
  - Example: optional browser filter → AND (variables.browser IS NULL OR properties.$browser = variables.browser)
  - Example: optional time window variable → keep WHERE timestamp guards and add variable checks only if explicitly requested
  - Optional org filter → AND (coalesce(variables.org, '') = '' OR p.properties.org = variables.org)
  - Optional browser filter → AND (variables.browser IS NULL OR properties.$browser = variables.browser)
  - Time window should remain enforced for events; add variable guards only if explicitly asked

# Examples
<example>
Example HogQL query for prompt "weekly active users that performed event ACTIVATION_EVENT on example.com/foo/ 3 times or more, by week":

```
SELECT week_of, countIf(weekly_event_count >= 3)
FROM (
   SELECT person.id AS person_id, toStartOfWeek(timestamp) AS week_of, count() AS weekly_event_count
   FROM events
   WHERE
      event = 'ACTIVATION_EVENT'
      AND properties.$current_url = 'https://example.com/foo/'
      AND toStartOfWeek(now()) - INTERVAL 8 WEEK <= timestamp
      AND timestamp < toStartOfWeek(now())
   GROUP BY person.id, week_of
)
GROUP BY week_of
ORDER BY week_of DESC
