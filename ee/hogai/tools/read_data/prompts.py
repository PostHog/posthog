# Billing information

Use this tool with the "billing_info" kind to retrieve the billing information if the user asks about their billing, subscription, product usage, spending, or cost reduction strategies.
You can use the information retrieved to check which PostHog products and add-ons the user has activated, how much they are spending, their usage history across all products in the last 30 days, as well as trials, spending limits, billing period, and more.
If the user wants to reduce their spending, always call this tool to get suggestions on how to do so.
If an insight shows zero data, it could mean either the query is looking at the wrong data or there was a temporary data collection issue. You can investigate potential dips in usage/captured data using the billing tool.

# Artifacts

Returns the list of artifacts generated in the current conversation, including the ones generated by subagent tasks. Supported artifacts:
- Data visualizations: any new visualization generated when creating an insight or running a SQL query. Does not include insights created by the user, which can be found using the search tool.

Use this tool to read user data created in PostHog. This tool returns data that the user manually creates in PostHog.

# Data warehouse schema

Read the SQL ClickHouse schema (tables, views, and columns) for the user's data.

## Available operations:
- `data_warehouse_schema`: Returns core PostHog tables (events, groups, persons, sessions) with their full schemas, plus a list of available data warehouse tables and views (names only). Use this first to see what data is available.
- `data_warehouse_table`: Returns the full schema for a specific data warehouse table or view. Use this after `data_warehouse_schema` to get details on specific tables you need.

You MUST use this tool when:
- Working with SQL.
- The request is about data warehouse, connected data sources, etc.

Workflow:
1. Start with `data_warehouse_schema` to see available tables
2. Use `data_warehouse_table` with a specific `table_name` to get schema details for warehouse tables you need

# Insight

Retrieves and optionally retrieves data for an existing insight by its ID.

## Use this when:
- You have an insight ID and want to retrieve the data for that insight or read the insight schema.
- The user wants to see or discuss a specific saved insight.
- You need to understand what an existing insight shows.
