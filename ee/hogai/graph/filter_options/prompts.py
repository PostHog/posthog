TOOL_USAGE_PROMPT = """
<tool_usage>
## Tool Usage Rules
1. **Property Discovery Required**: Use tools to find properties.
2. **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: EVENTS ARE NOT ENTITIES. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PROPERTIES AND VALUES.

3. **Tool Workflow**:
   - **For ENTITY properties** (person, session, organization, groups): Use `retrieve_entity_properties` and `retrieve_entity_property_values`
   - **For EVENT properties** (properties of specific events like pageview, signup, etc.): Use `retrieve_event_properties` and `retrieve_event_property_values`
   - Use `ask_user_for_help` when you need clarification
   - Use `final_answer` only when you have complete filter information
   - *CRITICAL*: NEVER use entity tools for event properties. NEVER use event tools for entity properties.
   - *CRITICAL*: DO NOT CALL A TOOL FOR THE SAME ENTITY, EVENT, OR PROPERTY MORE THAN ONCE. IF YOU HAVE NOT FOUND A MATCH YOU MUST TRY WITH THE NEXT BEST MATCH.

3. **When to Ask for Help**:
   - No properties found for the entity/group
   - Cannot infer the correct entity/group type
   - Property values don't match user's request
   - Any ambiguity in the user's request

4. **Value Handling**: CRITICAL: If found values aren't what the user asked for or none are found, YOU MUST USE THE USER'S ORIGINAL VALUE FROM THEIR QUERY. But if the user has not given a value then you ask the user for clarification.

5. **Tool Selection Decision Tree**:
   - If the user mentions a property that belongs to a person (browser, device, location, etc.) → use entity tools with entity="person"
   - If the user mentions a property that belongs to a session (duration, start time, etc.) → use entity tools with entity="session"
   - If the user mentions a property that belongs to a group (organization, account, etc.) → use entity tools with entity="[group_name]"
   - If the user mentions an action or event (signup, purchase, pageview, etc.) → use event tools with event_name="[event_name]"

GROUP_PROPERTY_FILTER_TYPES_PROMPT = """
<property_filter_types>
PostHog users can filter their data using various properties and values.
Properties are always associated with an event or entity. When looking for properties, determine first which event or entity a lookup property is associated with.

**CRITICAL**: There are two main categories of properties - ENTITY properties and EVENT properties. They use different tools.

<entity>
**ENTITY PROPERTIES** (use `retrieve_entity_properties` and `retrieve_entity_property_values`):

<person>
- Person Properties:
    Are associated with a person. For example, $browser, email, name, is_signed_up etc.
    Use the "name" field from the Person properties array (e.g., $browser, $device_type, email).
    Example: If filtering on browser type, you might use the key $browser.
    Use `retrieve_entity_properties` with entity="person" to get the list of all available person properties.
</person>

<session>
- Session Properties:
    Are associated with a session. For example, $start_timestamp, $entry_current_url, session duration etc.
    Use the "name" field from the Session properties array (e.g., $start_timestamp, $entry_current_url).
    Example: If filtering based on the session start time, you might use the key $start_timestamp.
    Use `retrieve_entity_properties` with entity="session" to get the list of all available session properties.
</session>

<group>
- Group Properties:
    PostHog users can group these events into custom groups. For example organisation, instance, account etc.
    This is the list of all the groups that this user can generate filters for:
    {{#groups}}{{.}}{{^last}}, {{/last}}{{/groups}}
    If the user mentions a group that is not in this list you MUST infer the most similar group to the one the user is referring to.
    Use `retrieve_entity_properties` with entity="[group_name]" to get the list of all available group properties.
</group>
</entity>
<events>
**EVENT PROPERTIES** (use `retrieve_event_properties` and `retrieve_event_property_values`):
- Event Properties:
    Properties of specific events. For example, if someone says "users who completed signup", you need to find the "signup" event and then get its properties.
    Use `retrieve_event_properties` with event_name="signup" to get properties of the signup event.
    Example: For filtering on the user's browser during signup, you might use the key $browser from the signup event.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of known event names:
{{{events}}}

If you find the event name the user is asking for in the list, use it to retrieve the event properties.
If a user specifies a raw event name that's not in the list above, that probably is a real event too.

FILTER_FIELDS_TAXONOMY_PROMPT = """
<filter_fields_taxonomy>
Below you will find information on how to correctly discover the taxonomy of the user's data.

<key> Field

- Purpose:
The <key> represents the name of the property on which the filter is applied.

- Type Determination:
The expected data type can be inferred from the property_type field provided in each property object:
- "String" indicates the value should be a string.
- "Numeric" indicates a numeric value.
- "Boolean" indicates a boolean value.
- "DateTime", "Duration" and other types should follow their respective formats.
- A null value for property_type means the type is flexible or unspecified; in such cases, rely on the property name's context.
</key>

<value> Field

- Purpose:
The <value> field is an array containing one or more values that the filter should match.

- Data Type Matching:
Ensure the values in this array match the expected type of the property identified by <key>. For example:
- For a property with property_type "String", the value should be provided as a string (e.g., ["Mobile"]).
- For a property with property_type "Numeric", the value should be a number (e.g., [10]).
- For a property with property_type "Boolean", the value should be either true or false (e.g., [true]).

- Multiple Values:
The <value> array can contain multiple items when the filter should match any one of several potential values.


<supported_operators>
Supported operators for the String or Numeric types are:
- equals
- doesn't equal
- contains
- doesn't contain
- matches regex
- doesn't match regex
- is set
- is not set

Supported operators for the DateTime type are:
- equals
- doesn't equal
- greater than
- less than
- is set
- is not set

Supported operators for the Boolean type are:
- equals
- doesn't equal
- is set
- is not set

All operators take a single value except for `equals` and `doesn't equal` which can take one or more values.

<response_formats>
Formats of responses
1. Question Response Format
When you need clarification or determines that additional information is required, you should return a response in the following format:
{
    "request": "Your clarifying question here."
}
2. Filter Response Format
Once all necessary data is collected, the agent should return the filter in this structured format:
{
    "data": {
        "date_from": "<date_from>",
        "date_to": "<date_to>",
        "duration": [{"key": "duration", "type": "recording", "value": <duration>, "operator": "gt"}],  // Use "gt", "lt", "gte", "lte"
        "filter_group": {
            "type": "<FilterLogicalOperator>",
            "values": [
            {
                "type": "<FilterLogicalOperator>",
                "values": [
                    {
                        "key": "<key>",

                ...
            },
        ]
    }
}

Notes:
1. Replace <date_from> and <date_to> with valid date strings.
2. <FilterLogicalOperator>, <PropertyFilterType>, and <PropertyOperator> should be replaced with their respective valid values defined in your system.
3. The filter_group structure is nested. The inner "values": [] array can contain multiple items if more than one filter is needed.
4. Ensure that the JSON output strictly follows these formats to maintain consistency and reliability in the filtering process.

WHEN GENERATING A FILTER BASED ON MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE OLD FILTERS. NEVER REMOVE ANY FILTERS.

<examples_and_rules>
## Examples and Rules

1. **Multi-Filter Example with AND Logic**

User: "Show me recordings of mobile users who completed signup"

json
{
"data": {
    "date_from": "-5d",
    "date_to": null,
    "duration": [{"key": "duration", "type": "recording", "value": 60, "operator": "gt"}],
    "filter_group": {
        "type": "AND",
        "values": [
            {
                "type": "AND",
                "values": [
                    {
                        "key": "$device_type",
                        "type": "event",
                        "value": ["Mobile"],
                        "operator": "exact"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "signup",
                        "type": "event",
                        "value": ["signup"],

                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
}

2. **Multi-Filter Example with OR Logic**

User: "Show me recordings of users who are either mobile OR desktop"

```json
{"data":{"date_from":"-5d","date_to":null,"duration":[{"key":"duration","type":"recording","value":60,"operator":"gt"}],"filter_group":{"type":"OR","values":[{"type":"AND","values":[{"key":"$device_type","type":"person","value":["Mobile"],"operator":"exact"}]},{"type":"AND","values":[{"key":"$device_type","type":"person","value":["Desktop"],"operator":"exact"}]}]}}}
```

Note: Some default properties, starting with the $ sign, are present in events and entities. For example, `$device_type` can be found under `person` properties and under the `$pageview` (or similar) event.


3. **Complex Multi-Filter Example**

User: "Show me recordings from last week of users from US who visited pricing page and made a purchase"

json
{
"data": {
    "date_from": "-7d",
    "date_to": null,
    "duration": [{"key": "duration", "type": "recording", "value": 60, "operator": "gt"}],
    "filter_group": {
        "type": "AND",
        "values": [
            {
                "type": "AND",
                "values": [
                    {

                        "value": ["US"],
                        "operator": "exact"
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "pricing_page_viewed",
                        "type": "event",
                        "value": ["pricing_page_viewed"],
                        "operator": "exact"
                    },

                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
}

4. **Operator Selection Guidelines**

- Default Operators:
In most cases, the operator can be either exact or contains:
- For instance, if a user says, *"show me recordings where people visit login page"*, use the contains operator ("icontains") since the URL may include parameters.

- Exact Matching Example:
If a user says, *"show me recordings where people use mobile phone"*, use the exact operator to target a specific device type.

5. **Special Cases**

- Frustrated Users (Rageclicks):
If the query is to show recordings of people who are frustrated, filter for recordings containing a rageclick event. For example, use the event with:
- "id": "$rageclick", "name": "$rageclick", "type": "event"

- Users Facing Bugs/Errors/Problems:
For queries asking for recordings of users experiencing bugs or errors, target recordings with many console errors. An example filter might look like:
- Key: "level", Type: "log_entry", Value: ["error"], Operator: "exact".

- Default Filter Group:
The blank, default `filter_group` value you can use is:

json
{
    "type": "AND",
    "values": [
        {
            "type": "AND",
            "values": []
        }
    ]
}

- Show all recordings / clean filters:
Return a default filter with default date range and no duration.

json
{
    "data":
    {
            "order": "start_time",
            "date_to": "null",
            "duration": [{"key": "duration", "type": "recording", "value": 60, "operator": "gt"}],
            "date_from": "-3d",
            "filter_group": {"type": "AND", "values": [{"type": "AND", "values": []}]},
            "filter_test_accounts": "true",
        }
}

6. If a customer asks for recordings from a specific date but without a specific end date, set date_to to null.
7. If a customer asks for recordings from a specific date but without specifying the year or month, use the current year and month.
