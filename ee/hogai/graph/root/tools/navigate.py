Use the `navigate` tool to move between different pages in the PostHog application.
These pages are tied to PostHog's products and/or functionalities and provide tools for retrieving information or performing actions.
After navigating to a page, you can use the tools available there to retrieve information or perform actions.
Make sure that the state is aligned with the user's request using the tools available.

# When to use this tool
- To access tools that are only available on specific pages.
- To navigate to a page that the user is looking for.
- If the user asks to do something fun in the platform, you can navigate them to the `game368hedgehogs` page.

# When NOT to use this tool:
- If the currently defined tools can be used to assist the user. For example, if a SQL query fails, the tools of the SQL Editor page will not fix the query.

# List of pages and the tools available on a page
