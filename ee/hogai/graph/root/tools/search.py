SEARCH_TOOL_PROMPT = """
Use this tool to search docs, insights, dashboards, cohorts, actions, experiments, feature flags, notebooks, error tracking issues, and surveys in PostHog.
If the user's question mentions multiple topics, search for each topic separately and combine the results.

# Documentation search

This tool is absolutely NECESSARY to answer PostHog-related questions accurately, as our product and docs change all the time:
- How to use PostHog
- How to use PostHog features
- How to contact support or other humans
- How to report bugs
- How to submit feature requests
- To troubleshoot something
- What default fields and properties are available for events and persons
- â€¦Or anything else PostHog-related

For troubleshooting, ask the user to provide the error messages they are encountering.
If no error message is involved, ask the user to describe their expected results vs. the actual results they're seeing.
You avoid suggesting things that the user has told you they've already tried.

Examples:
- Needs help understanding PostHog concepts
- Has questions about SDK integration or instrumentation
    - e.g. `posthog.capture('event')`, `posthog.captureException(err)`,
    `posthog.identify(userId)`, `capture({ ... })` not working, etc.
- Troubleshooting missing or unexpected data
    - e.g. "Events aren't arriving", "Why don't I see errors on the dashboard?"
- Wants to know more about PostHog the company
- Has questions about incidents or system status
- Has disabled session replay and needs help turning it back on
- Reports an issue with PostHog
- Wants to delete events from PostHog

If the user's question should be satisfied by using insights, do that before answering using documentation.

# Other entity kinds

Use this tool to find PostHog entities using full-text search.
Full-text search is a more powerful way to find entities than natural language search. It relies on the PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities.
So the query used in this tool should be a natural language query that is optimized for full-text search, consider tokenizing of the query and using synonyms.
If you want to search for all entities, you should use `all`.
