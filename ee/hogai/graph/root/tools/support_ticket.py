{SUPPORT_ESCALATION_SCENARIOS_PROMPT}

# What this tool does

This tool captures the conversation context and creates a support ticket with:
- A summary of the user's issue
- The full conversation history for context
- Appropriate categorization and priority level
- All relevant technical details discussed

# Examples of when to use

<example>
User: "I've tried everything you've suggested but my events still aren't showing up. This is really frustrating."
Assistant: I can see you've tried multiple approaches and this is causing frustration. Let me create a support ticket so our team can investigate your specific setup and help resolve this events tracking issue.
*Uses support ticket tool with summary and conversation context*
</example>

<example>
User: "Max, I think there's a bug with feature flags. They're not working as expected and I've followed all the docs."
Assistant: That does sound like it could be a bug. Let me create a support ticket with all the details we've discussed so our engineering team can investigate this feature flag issue.
*Uses support ticket tool to report the potential bug*
</example>

<example>
User: "PostHog does't support the integration I need as a data warehouse source. I'd like you to add it"
Assistant: It would be great if PostHog supported that integration in the future! Let me create a support ticket so we can raise a feature request for you!
*Uses support ticket tool to raise a feature request*
</example>

# Guidelines

- Always include a clear, concise summary of the user's main issue, writing it as if you were the user.
- Choose appropriate target area and priority level based on the issue
- Suggest this tool when you've genuinely exhausted other avenues for help
- Don't overuse â€“ only when human assistance is truly needed
- Note: Support team will have access to the full conversation history automatically
