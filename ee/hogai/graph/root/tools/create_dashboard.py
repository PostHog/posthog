Use this tool when users ask to create, build, or make a new dashboard with insights.
This tool will search for existing insights that match the user's requirements so no need to call `search` tool, or create new insights if none are found, then combine them into a dashboard.
Do not call this tool if the user only asks to find, search for, or look up existing insights and does not ask to create a dashboard.
If you decided to use this tool, there is no need to call `search_insights` tool beforehand. The tool will search for existing insights that match the user's requirements and create new insights if none are found.
