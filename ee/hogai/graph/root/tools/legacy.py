class create_and_query_insight(BaseModel):
    """
    Use this tool to spawn a subagent that will create a product analytics insight for a given description.
    The tool generates a query and returns formatted text results for a specific data question or iterates on a previous query. It only retrieves a single query per call. If the user asks for multiple insights, you need to decompose a query into multiple subqueries and call the tool for each subquery.

    Follow these guidelines when retrieving data:
    - If the same insight is already in the conversation history, reuse the retrieved data only when this does not violate the <data_analysis_guidelines> section (i.e. only when a presence-check, count, or sort on existing columns is enough).
    - If analysis results have been provided, use them to answer the user's question. The user can already see the analysis results as a chart - you don't need to repeat the table with results nor explain each data point.
    - If the retrieved data and any data earlier in the conversations allow for conclusions, answer the user's question and provide actionable feedback.
    - If there is a potential data issue, retrieve a different new analysis instead of giving a subpar summary. Note: empty data is NOT a potential data issue.
    - If the query cannot be answered with a UI-built insight type - trends, funnels, retention - choose the SQL type to answer the question (e.g. for listing events or aggregating in ways that aren't supported in trends/funnels/retention).

    IMPORTANT: Avoid generic advice. Take into account what you know about the product. Your answer needs to be super high-impact and no more than a few sentences.
    Remember: do NOT retrieve data for the same query more than 3 times in a row.

    # Data schema

    You can pass events, actions, properties, and property values to this tool by specifying the "Data schema" section.

    <example>
    User: Calculate onboarding completion rate for the last week.
    Assistant: I'm going to retrieve the existing data schema first.
    *Retrieves matching events, properties, and property values*
    Assistant: I'm going to create a new trends insight.
    *Calls this tool with the query description: "Trends insight of the onboarding completion rate. Data schema: Relevant matching data schema"*
    </example>

    # Supported insight types
    ## Trends
    A trends insight visualizes events over time using time series. They're useful for finding patterns in historical data.

    The trends insights have the following features:
    - The insight can show multiple trends in one request.
    - Custom formulas can calculate derived metrics, like `A/B*100` to calculate a ratio.
    - Filter and break down data using multiple properties.
    - Compare with the previous period and sample data.
    - Apply various aggregation types, like sum, average, etc., and chart types.
    - And more.

    Examples of use cases include:
    - How the product's most important metrics change over time.
    - Long-term patterns, or cycles in product's usage.
    - The usage of different features side-by-side.
    - How the properties of events vary using aggregation (sum, average, etc).
    - Users can also visualize the same data points in a variety of ways.

    ## Funnel
    A funnel insight visualizes a sequence of events that users go through in a product. They use percentages as the primary aggregation type. Funnels use two or more series, so the conversation history should mention at least two events.

    The funnel insights have the following features:
    - Various visualization types (steps, time-to-convert, historical trends).
    - Filter data and apply exclusion steps.
    - Break down data using a single property.
    - Specify conversion windows, details of conversion calculation, attribution settings.
    - Sample data.
    - And more.

    Examples of use cases include:
    - Conversion rates.
    - Drop off steps.
    - Steps with the highest friction and time to convert.
    - If product changes are improving their funnel over time.
    - Average/median time to convert.
    - Conversion trends over time.

    ## Retention
    A retention insight visualizes how many users return to the product after performing some action. They're useful for understanding user engagement and retention.

    The retention insights have the following features: filter data, sample data, and more.

    Examples of use cases include:
    - How many users come back and perform an action after their first visit.
    - How many users come back to perform action X after performing action Y.
    - How often users return to use a specific feature.

    ## SQL
    The 'sql' insight type allows you to write arbitrary SQL queries to retrieve data.

    The SQL insights have the following features:
    - Filter data using arbitrary SQL.
    - All ClickHouse SQL features.
    - You can nest subqueries as needed.

class session_summarization(BaseModel):
    """
    Use this tool to summarize session recordings by analysing the events within those sessions to find patterns and issues.
    It will return a textual summary of the captured session recordings.

    # When to use the tool:
    When the user asks to summarize session recordings:
    - "summarize" synonyms: "watch", "analyze", "review", and similar
    - "session recordings" synonyms: "sessions", "recordings", "replays", "user sessions", and similar

    # When NOT to use the tool:
    - When the user asks to find, search for, or look up session recordings, but doesn't ask to summarize them
    - When users asks to update, change, or adjust session recordings filters

    # Synonyms
    - "summarize": "watch", "analyze", "review", and similar
    - "session recordings": "sessions", "recordings", "replays", "user sessions", and similar

    # Managing context
    If the conversation history contains context about the current filters or session recordings, follow these steps:
    - Convert the user query into a `session_summarization_query`
    - The query should be used to understand the user's intent
    - Decide if the query is relevant to the current filters and set `should_use_current_filters` accordingly
    - Generate the `summary_title` based on the user's query and the current filters

    Otherwise:
    - Convert the user query into a `session_summarization_query`
    - The query should be used to search for relevant sessions and then summarize them
    - Assume the `should_use_current_filters` should be always `false`
    - Generate the `summary_title` based on the user's query

    # Additional guidelines
    - CRITICAL: Always pass the user's complete, unmodified query to the `session_summarization_query` parameter
    - DO NOT truncate, summarize, or extract keywords from the user's query
    - The query is used to find relevant sessions - context helps find better matches
    - Use explicit tool definition to make a decision

        - Examples:
