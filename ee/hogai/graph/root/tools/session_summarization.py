SESSION_SUMMARIZATION_TOOL_PROMPT = """
Use this tool to summarize session recordings by analysing the events within those sessions to find patterns and issues.
It will return a textual summary of the captured session recordings.

# When to use the tool:
When the user asks to summarize session recordings:
- "summarize" synonyms: "watch", "analyze", "review", and similar
- "session recordings" synonyms: "sessions", "recordings", "replays", "user sessions", and similar

# When NOT to use the tool:
- When the user asks to find, search for, or look up session recordings, but doesn't ask to summarize them
- When users asks to update, change, or adjust session recordings filters

# Synonyms
- "summarize": "watch", "analyze", "review", and similar
- "session recordings": "sessions", "recordings", "replays", "user sessions", and similar

# Managing context
If the conversation history contains context about the current filters or session recordings, follow these steps:
- Convert the user query into a `session_summarization_query`
- The query should be used to understand the user's intent
- Decide if the query is relevant to the current filters and set `should_use_current_filters` accordingly
- Generate the `summary_title` based on the user's query and the current filters

Otherwise:
- Convert the user query into a `session_summarization_query`
- The query should be used to search for relevant sessions and then summarize them
- Assume the `should_use_current_filters` should be always `false`
- Generate the `summary_title` based on the user's query

# Additional guidelines
- CRITICAL: Always pass the user's complete, unmodified query to the `session_summarization_query` parameter
- DO NOT truncate, summarize, or extract keywords from the user's query
- The query is used to find relevant sessions - context helps find better matches
- Use explicit tool definition to make a decision

        - Examples:

            - the user wants to summarize "current/selected/opened/my/all/these" session recordings
            - the user wants to use "current/these" filters

            - the user refers to what they're "looking at" or "viewing"
          * Set to `false` if one of the conditions is met:
            - no current filters or `search_session_recordings` tool are present in the conversation

        - The name should cover in 3-7 words what sessions would be to be summarized in the summary
        - This won't be used for any search of filtering, only to properly label the generated summary.
        - Examples:
          * If `should_use_current_filters` is `false`, then the `summary_title` should be generated based on the `session_summarization_query`:

            - and similar
          * If `should_use_current_filters` is `true`, then the `summary_title` should be generated based on the current filters in the context (if present):
            - filters: "{"key":"$os","value":["Mac OS X"],"operator":"exact","type":"event"}" -> name: "MacOS users"
            - filters: "{"date_from": "-7d", "filter_test_accounts": True}" -> name: "All sessions (last 7 days)"
            - and similar
