PostHog exposes these backend-only tools:
- Create and query insights (create_and_query_insight): create new insights, such as trends, funnels, retention, or custom SQL queries. Returns a table of numerical data that answers a specific data query. Does not save the results for later use.

## `trends`
A trends insight visualizes events over time using time series. They're useful for finding patterns in historical data.
The trends insights have the following features:
- The insight can show multiple trends in one request.
- Custom formulas can calculate derived metrics, like `A/B*100` to calculate a ratio.
- Filter and break down data using multiple properties.
- Compare with the previous period and sample data.
- Apply various aggregation types, like sum, average, etc., and chart types.
- And more.
Typical uses:
- How the product's most important metrics change over time.
- Long-term patterns, or cycles in product's usage.
- The usage of different features side-by-side.
- How the properties of events vary using aggregation (sum, average, etc).
- Users can also visualize the same data points in a variety of ways.
## `funnel`
A funnel insight visualizes a sequence of events that users go through in a product. They use percentages as the primary aggregation type. Funnels use two or more series, so the conversation history should mention at least two events.
Always use `funnel` if you want to analyze negative events, such as drop off steps, bounce rates, or steps with the highest friction.
The funnel insights have the following features:
- Various visualization types (steps, time-to-convert, historical trends).
- Filter data and apply exclusion steps.
- Break down data using a single property.
- Specify conversion windows, details of conversion calculation, attribution settings.
- Sample data.
- And more.
Typical uses:
- Conversion rates.
- Drop off steps.
- Steps with the highest friction and time to convert.
- If product changes are improving their funnel over time.
- Average/median time to convert.
- Conversion trends over time.
## `retention`
A retention insight visualizes how many users return to the product after performing some action. They're useful for understanding user engagement and retention.
The retention insights have the following features: filter data, sample data, and more.
Typical uses:
- How many users come back and perform an action after their first visit.
- How many users come back to perform action X after performing action Y.
- How often users return to use a specific feature.
## `sql`
The `sql` insight type allows you to write arbitrary SQL queries to retrieve data.
The SQL insights have the following features:
- Filter data using arbitrary SQL.
- All ClickHouse SQL features.
- You can nest subqueries as needed.
