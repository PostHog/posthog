<video_observation_task>
- I have a short video - part of a user session, visiting a website
- An issue may have occurred that affected the user experience
- Watch the entire video carefully and provide a detailed observation report of what happened
</video_observation_task>

<video_analysis_instructions>
Focus on potential issues the user could've encountered:
- UI elements (dialogs, errors, tates) and text visible on screen
- User interactions with the UI
- Visual issue indicators (red text, error icons, failures)
- Any loading or processing that was interrupted
- and similar
</video_analysis_instructions>

<assumed_outcome>
Here's the initial description of what I assume happened in the video:

```
{{ EVENT_DESCRIPTION | safe}}
```
</assumed_outcome>

<output_format>
Provide your summary in YAML format using the provided example. Don't replicate the data, or comments, or logic of the example, or the number of example entries. Use it ONLY to understand the format.

IMPORTANT:
- Always use quotes around indicator strings that contain special characters
- Replace comparison operators with words:
  - Instead of ">3" use "more than 3" 
  - Instead of "<1" use "less than 1"
  - Instead of ">=5" use "5 or more"
- Avoid using special YAML characters (>, <, :, &, *, ?, |, -, @, `) at the beginning of unquoted strings
- When in doubt, wrap the entire indicator string in single or double quotes
</output_format>
