<video_observation_task>
- I have a short video - part of a user session, visiting a website
- An issue may have occurred that affected the user experience
- Watch the entire video carefully and provide a detailed observation report of what happened
</video_observation_task>

<observation_guidelines>
Focus on capturing:

USER ACTIONS:
- What the user was trying to accomplish
- Which UI elements they interacted with
- Whether their actions succeeded or failed

ERRORS & ISSUES:
- Exact text of any error messages, warnings, or notifications (use quotation marks)
- Visual problem indicators (red text, error icons, failed states, stopped spinners)
- Unexpected UI behaviors, state changes, or system responses that seem abnormal

CONTEXT:
- Relevant on-screen text or labels
- State of the interface before and after issues, if any
- Any patterns or notable details about the interaction

IMPORTANT: 
- Report only what you directly observe. 
- Don't mention or focus on specific timecodes, only ensure the chronological order
- Be factual, avoiding interpretation or speculation.
</observation_guidelines>

<assumption>
For reference, I initially suspected this issue occurred: 

"{{ EVENT_DESCRIPTION | safe}}"

However, describe everything you observe, not just what relates to this assumption.
</assumption>

<output_instructions>
- Provide a natural language summary of your observations, 5-15 sentences based on activity
- Ensure to mention only actions and behaviors that were actually observed through the video
- Keep language clear and factual - write as if describing to someone who cannot see the video
