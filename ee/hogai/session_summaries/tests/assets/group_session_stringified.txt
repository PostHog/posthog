# Patterns

## Pattern: Session Summaries Dead End (critical)
The Session Summaries view repeatedly fails to load (placeholder or 5xx responses) and users abandon the page after several retries, blocking discovery of the new feature.

### Potential indicators
- Navigation to "/session-summaries" followed by one or more "client_request_failure" events
- Page reloads or returns to the same URL within less than 2 minutes without ever fetching data successfully
- Segment outcome or session outcome includes the words "abandoned", "placeholder", or "coming soon" for Session Summaries
- Confusion events (rage-clicks, repeated clicks) recorded on the Session Summaries page

### Session examples

#### Session `019a58ac-ac6f-76db-b53f-4074ed3bb190` - Segment #2
Repeated attempts to load Session Summaries with failures

**Key event:**
- Issues noticed: abandonment. Left page after repeated failures at 00:13:26, as "$pageleave" event (event_uuid: `019a58b8-fd43-7be5-b466-7d60ed48972e`).

**Before it:**
- Loaded placeholder 'coming soon' content at 00:09:01, as "client_request_failure" event (event_uuid: `019a58b8-fd43-7be5-b466-7d60ed48972e`).
- Issues noticed: confusion. Closed side panel while searching for fix at 00:09:02, as "$autocapture" (click) event (event_uuid: `019a58b8-fd43-7be5-b466-7d60ed48972e`).
- Issues noticed: non-blocking exception. Feature flags error surfaced during retries at 00:10:40, as "onFeatureFlags error" event (event_uuid: `019a58b8-fd43-7be5-b466-7d60ed48972e`).

**After it:**
- Nothing, end of the segment.

**Outcome:**
Failure. Placeholder content shown; user left page.

#### Session `019a58ac-ac6f-76db-b53f-4074ed3bb190` - Segment #3
Final reload after idle, still failing

**Key event:**
- Issues noticed: blocking exception. API failure immediately repeats at 00:26:49, as "client_request_failure" event (event_uuid: `019a58c5-3e07-720f-a7bf-f14ad666be92`).

**Before it:**
- Reloaded Session Summaries page after idle at 00:26:48, as "$pageview" event (event_uuid: `019a58c5-3e07-720f-a7bf-f14ad666be92`).

**After it:**
- Issues noticed: confusion. Dismissed banner without resolving issue at 00:26:55, as "$autocapture" (click) event (event_uuid: `019a58c5-3e07-720f-a7bf-f14ad666be92`).

**Outcome:**
Failure. Return visit still failed due to same API errors.

#### Session `019a58ac-ac6f-76db-b53f-4074ed3bb190` - Segment #2
Repeated attempts to load Session Summaries with failures

**Key event:**
- Issues noticed: confusion. Closed side panel while searching for fix at 00:09:02, as "$autocapture" (click) event (event_uuid: `019a58b4-f59f-7d90-9689-5713bfd7ac1f`).

**Before it:**
- Loaded placeholder 'coming soon' content at 00:09:01, as "client_request_failure" event (event_uuid: `019a58b4-f59f-7d90-9689-5713bfd7ac1f`).

**After it:**
- Issues noticed: non-blocking exception. Feature flags error surfaced during retries at 00:10:40, as "onFeatureFlags error" event (event_uuid: `019a58b4-f59f-7d90-9689-5713bfd7ac1f`).

**Outcome:**
Failure. Placeholder content shown; user left page.

**After it:**
- Nothing, end of the segment.

**Outcome:**
Failure. Return visit still failed due to same API errors.

#### Session `019a5952-220f-7193-a552-6a2ecfbd92bd` - Segment #2
Attempt Session Summaries (multiple API failures)

**Key event:**
- Issues noticed: confusion, blocking exception. API failures blocked Session Summaries load at 00:20:13, as "client_request_failure" event (event_uuid: `019a5964-ab83-7737-ae00-d70f185f8e8d`).

**Before it:**
- Navigated to Session Summaries page at 00:20:05, as "$autocapture" (click) event (event_uuid: `019a5964-ab83-7737-ae00-d70f185f8e8d`).
- Issues noticed: abandonment, confusion. User quickly left page after failure at 00:20:07, as "$pageleave" event (event_uuid: `019a5964-ab83-7737-ae00-d70f185f8e8d`).

**After it:**
- Nothing, end of the segment.

**Outcome:**
Failure. Session Summaries never loaded; repeated failures led to abandonment.

## Pattern: Error-Driven Rage-Clicks (high)
After encountering a blocking error or pay-gate, users rapidly click the same element (rage-click) and then abandon the flow, signalling high frustration.

### Potential indicators
- Rageclick event occurs within 10 seconds after an error, pay-gate, or blocking exception
- Segment confusion_count 1 or more and abandonment_count 1 in the same segment
- Multiple identical $autocapture clicks on the same selector within less than 5 seconds
- Session outcome notes "frustration", "rage-click", or "left without completing task"

### Session examples

#### Session `019a5a31-6bbd-7203-9766-90d9c8ad1eb4` - Segment #1
Blocked attempting to open settings, frustration follows

**Key event:**
- Issues noticed: abandonment, confusion. Rage-clicks on blocked element, then session ends at 00:00:15, as "$autocapture" (click) event (event_uuid: `019a5a33-7b18-78ed-8f6b-7a1042bcb624`).

**Before it:**
- Clicked to access project/environment settings at 00:00:05, as "$autocapture" (click) event (event_uuid: `019a5a33-7b18-78ed-8f6b-7a1042bcb624`).
- Pay-gate surfaced, blocking settings access at 00:00:05, as "$autocapture" (click) event (event_uuid: `019a5a33-7b18-78ed-8f6b-7a1042bcb624`).

**After it:**
- Nothing, end of the segment.

**Outcome:**
Failure. Pay-gate stopped settings exploration; frustration led to abandonment.
