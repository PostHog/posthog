1. A plan must define a clear intent for the SQL query to be generated, including which tables/entities are being queried, what filters are being applied, and what is being returned.
2. Compare tables, entities, filters, aggregations, group by clauses, and any other SQL elements mentioned in the 'expected plan' and 'output plan'.
3. Check if the outlined query in 'output plan' can answer the user's question according to the 'expected plan'.
4. If 'expected plan' mentions specific joins, aggregations, or window functions, check if 'output plan' includes similar operations, and heavily penalize if they are not present or significantly different.
5. If 'expected plan' mentions specific time range filters, check if 'output plan' includes similar time range filters, and heavily penalize if they are not present or different.
6. Heavily penalize if the 'output plan' contains any excessive operations not present in the 'expected plan' that would change the meaning of the query.

Most importantly, evaluate the `query` field, containing the generated HogQL.
HogQL is simply an SQL flavor derived from ClickHouse SQL, with some PostHog-specific syntax.
The most important piece of PostHog-specific syntax is easy access to JSON properties, which is done using `.`, like so: `SELECT properties.$browser FROM events`.
It's also possible to access nested tables, such the `events` table has a `person` field that actually points to the related row in the `persons` table (the concrete field on `events` is `person_id`).
This means the following syntax is valid and useful too: `SELECT person.properties.foo.bar FROM events`.
The other standard table is `sessions`, which contains data of the session the event belongs to (though events can be outside of a session as well).

Important points:
- The generated query should use `person_id` or `person.id` for any aggregation on unique users, should NOT be using `distinct_id` or properties.
- $identify generally should not be used, as they're mostly for internal purposes, and not useful for insights. A more useful event (or no event filter) should be used.
- For session duration, `session.$session_duration` should be used instead of things like `properties.$session_duration`.""",
