Logic:
- **Layer 1 (Feature Usage Calculation)**: For each user, count occurrences of each event type (uploads, downloads, shares, invites, upgrades, downgrades) within their first 30 days of activity using `countIf()` aggregation. Also calculate total event count with `count()` and find first activity date with `MIN(timestamp)`.
- **Layer 2 (Churn Status Determination)**: For each user, determine if they had any activity between days 31-90 after their first activity using window function `MIN(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY person_id)` to establish baseline, then `MAX(activity_31_90)` aggregation to check for any activity in the churn observation period.
- **Layer 3 (User Metrics Join)**: Join feature usage data with churn status on person_id to create complete user profiles with both feature usage and churn outcome.
- **Layer 4 (Feature Analysis)**: For each feature type, calculate correlation metrics using `AVG()` for churn rates, `CASE WHEN` conditional aggregation for segmented averages, and `corr()` for correlation coefficients between feature usage and churn.
- **Layer 5 (Results Union)**: Combine results for all features using `UNION ALL` and sort by absolute correlation coefficient using `ORDER BY ABS(correlation_coefficient) DESC`.

Sources:
- events table (primary analysis)
    - Used to count feature usage events in first 30 days per user
    - Filtered with `WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 120 DAY` for performance
    - Grouped by person_id with `HAVING first_activity_date <= now() - INTERVAL 90 DAY` to ensure complete observation window
- events table (churn determination)
    - Used to detect activity patterns in days 31-90 after first activity
    - Same timestamp filter applied for consistency
    - Window function applied to establish per-user activity timeline
    - Grouped by person_id to determine final churn status

Query kind:
- **Cohort Analysis with Feature Correlation**: Chosen over simple churn analysis because it provides predictive insights by correlating specific feature usage patterns with retention outcomes. UNION ALL structure allows systematic comparison across multiple features while maintaining identical time windows and churn definitions. CTE approach chosen over subqueries for performance optimization since the same complex user metrics calculation is needed for all features.

Tradeoffs:
- **Time Window Rigidity**: Fixed 30-day feature observation and 60-day churn observation periods may miss users with different engagement patterns, but provides consistent comparison framework.
- **Binary Churn Definition**: Treats any activity in days 31-90 as "retained" regardless of engagement depth, which may miss nuanced retention patterns but simplifies correlation analysis.
- **Historical Data Limitation**: Requires 90+ days of historical data per user, limiting analysis to older cohorts and excluding recent signups from correlation insights.
- **Feature Usage Counting**: Simple event counting doesn't account for usage intensity or quality (e.g., file size for uploads), but enables straightforward correlation calculation across diverse feature types.
- **Memory vs Computation**: CTE approach trades memory usage for computational efficiency by materializing user metrics once rather than recalculating for each feature analysis.

Most importantly, evaluate the `query` field, containing the generated HogQL.
HogQL is simply an SQL flavor derived from ClickHouse SQL, with some PostHog-specific syntax.
The most important piece of PostHog-specific syntax is easy access to JSON properties, which is done using `.`, like so: `SELECT properties.$browser FROM events`.
It's also possible to access nested tables, such the `events` table has a `person` field that actually points to the related row in the `persons` table (the concrete field on `events` is `person_id`).
This means the following syntax is valid and useful too: `SELECT person.properties.foo.bar FROM events`.
The other standard table is `sessions`, which contains data of the session the event belongs to (though events can be outside of a session as well).

Important points:
- The generated query should use `person_id` or `person.id` for any aggregation on unique users, should NOT be using `distinct_id` or properties.
- $identify generally should not be used, as they're mostly for internal purposes, and not useful for insights. A more useful event (or no event filter) should be used.
- For session duration, `session.$session_duration` should be used instead of things like `properties.$session_duration`.""",
