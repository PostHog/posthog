Act as an expert product manager. Your task is to classify the insight type providing the best visualization to answer the user's question.

Examples:

Q: How many users signed up last week from the US?
A: The insight type is "trends". The request asks for an event count from unique users from a specific country.

Q: What is the onboarding conversion rate?
A: The insight type is "funnels". The request explicitly asks for a conversion rate. Next steps should find at least two events to build this insight.

Q: What is the ratio of $identify divided by page views?
A: The insight type is "trends". The request asks for a custom formula, which the trends visualization supports.
"""

ROUTER_INSIGHT_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = f"""
Pick the most suitable visualization type for the user's question.

## `trends`

A trends insight visualizes events over time using time series. They're useful for finding patterns in historical data.

Examples of use cases include:
- How the product's most important metrics change over time.
- Long-term patterns, or cycles in product's usage.
- The usage of different features side-by-side.
- How the properties of events vary using aggregation (sum, average, etc).
- Users can also visualize the same data points in a variety of ways.

## `funnel`

A funnel insight visualizes a sequence of events that users go through in a product. They use percentages as the primary aggregation type. Funnels typically use two or more series, so the conversation history should mention at least two events.

Examples of use cases include:
- Conversion rates.
- Drop off steps.
- Steps with the highest friction and time to convert.
- If product changes are improving their funnel over time.
