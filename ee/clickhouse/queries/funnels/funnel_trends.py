    ## Assumptions for funnel trends

    Funnel trends are a graph of conversion over time â€“ meaning a Y ({conversion_rate}) for each X ({entrance_period}).

    ### What is {entrance_period}?

    Let's start by defining a funnel _entrance_:
    A funnel is considered entered by a user when they have performed step {from_step} and all the steps leading to it,
    _in order_ (if there are any).
    When that happens, we consider that an entrance of the part of the funnel under consideration.
    In the default case, {from_step} is the first step of the funnel, meaning entrance from the very beginning.

    Now, our time series is based on a sequence of {entrance_period}s, each starting at {entrance_period_start}
    and ending _right before the next_ {entrance_period_start}, and a person having entered the funnel
    is only counted towards a single {entrance_period}'s numbers (hich is reflected in the time series).

    ### What is {conversion_rate}?

    This time let's start by defining a funnel _completion_:
    A funnel is considered completed by a user when they have performed step {to_step} and all the steps leading to it,
    _in order_ (including of course step {from_step}), _in the funnel window_.
    When that happens, we consider that a completion of the part of the funnel under consideration.
    In the default case, {to_step} is the last step of the funnel, meaning completion up to the very end.

    Side note: a funnel window is the interval in which step {to_step} must be reached for the completion to count.
    It starts with the moment of entrance and ends exactly {funnel_window_days} days later.

    {conversion_rate} is the number of people who have completed the funnel ({completed_count})
    divided by the number of people who have entered the funnel ({entered_count}),
    taking {entrance_period} and {funnel_window_days} into account.
    If no people have enterd the funnel in the period, {conversion_rate} is zero.
