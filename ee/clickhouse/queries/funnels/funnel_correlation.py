        Run the diagnose query.

        Funnel Correlation queries take as input the same as the funnel query,
        and returns the correlation of person events with a person successfully
        getting to the end of the funnel. We use Odds Ratios as the correlation
        metric. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio for more details.

        Roughly speaking, to calculate the odds ratio, we build a contingency
        table https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table for each
        dimension, then calculate the odds ratio for each.

        For example, take for simplicity the cohort of all people, and the
        success criteria of having a "signed up" event. First we would build a
        contingency table like:

        |                    | success | failure | total |
        | -----------------: | :-----: | :-----: | :---: |
        | watched video      |    5    |    1    |   6   |
        | didn't watch video |    2    |   10    |   12  |


        Then the odds that a person signs up given they watched the video is 5 /
        6.
        
        And the odds that a person signs up given they didn't watch the video is
        2 / 12.

        So we say the odds ratio is 5 / 6 over 2 / 12 = 5 . The further away the
        odds ratio is from 1, the greater the correlation.

        Requirements:

         - Intitially we only need to consider the names of events that a cohort
           person has emitted. So we explicitly are not interested in e.g.
           correlating properties, although this will be a follow-up.

        Non-functional requirements:

         - there can be perhaps millions of people in a cohort, so we should
           consider this when writing the algorithm. e.g. we should probably
           avoid pulling all people into across the wire.
         - there can be an order of magnitude more events than people, so we
           should avoid pulling all events across the wire.
         - there may be a large but not huge number of distinct events, let's say
           100 different names for events. We should avoid n+1 queries for the
           event names dimension

        Contincency tables are something we can pull out of the db, so we can
        have a query that:

         1. filters people by the cohort criteria
         2. groups these people by the success criteria
         3. groups people by our criterion with which we want to test
            correlation, e.g. "watched video"
