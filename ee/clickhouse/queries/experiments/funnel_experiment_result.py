    This class calculates Experiment Results.
    It returns two things:
    1. A Funnel Breakdown based on Feature Flag values
    2. Probability that Feature Flag value 1 has better conversion rate then FeatureFlag value 2

    Currently, it only supports two feature flag values: control and test

    The passed in Filter determines which funnel to create, along with the experiment start & end date values

    Calculating (2) uses sampling from a Beta distribution. If `control` value for the feature flag has 10 successes and 12 conversion failures,
    we assume the conversion rate follows a Beta(10, 12) distribution. Same for `test` variant.

    Then, we calculcate how many times a sample from `test` variant is higher than a sample from the `control` variant. This becomes the
    probability.
