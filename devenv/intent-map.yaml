# Intent-based developer environment configuration
#
# This file defines the domain model for developer environments:
# - Intent: What the developer is working on (products like error_tracking, session_replay)
# - Capabilities: Stable abstractions (event_ingestion, replay_storage, etc.)
#
# Process definitions (which processes provide which capability) are in bin/mprocs.yaml.
# Each process declares its capability via the `capability` field.

version: '1.0'

# Capabilities are stable abstractions over processes
# - requires: dependencies resolved transitively
# - docker_profiles: docker compose profiles to activate (see docker-compose.profiles.yml)
# - Processes are NOT listed here - they declare their capability in mprocs.yaml
