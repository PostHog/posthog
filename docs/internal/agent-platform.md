# Plan: Agent platform — posthog implementation

## Context

Companion to [`agent-stack/docs/agent-platform.md`](https://github.com/PostHog/agent-stack/blob/main/docs/agent-platform.md). That doc covers the full system; this one is the posthog-side build plan. Where the two conflict, this plan wins for posthog-side concerns.

Two things we own here:

1. **Management plane** — a new flag-gated product under `products/agents/` (Django app + viewsets + frontend), modelled on the existing [`products/deployments/`](../../products/deployments) scaffold from #58421.
2. **Runtime** — three new TypeScript packages under `packages/`, deployed as independent node processes. They share **no code** with `nodejs/` (the legacy plugin-server). Anything we want from `nodejs/` we copy and adapt in `packages/agent-core/`.

The runtime split (ingress + runner) from the agent-stack doc still holds. This plan refines what each half looks like inside the posthog monorepo and which existing primitives we lean on conceptually (not by import).

---

## Runtime packages

Three packages under `packages/`, each its own process / deployment:

```
packages/
  agent-core/        # shared types, db client, queue primitives, manifest reader
  agent-ingress/     # process: HTTP ingress, *.agents.posthog.com terminator
  agent-runner/      # process: session executor (Claude Agent SDK + tools + sandbox)
```

A fourth package will land later for async bundle validation (see §C below). v1 does not ship it.

**Hard rule: no imports from `nodejs/`.** When we need a primitive that exists in `nodejs/` (cyclotron queue ops, structured logger, Prom metrics middleware, Postgres connection pool wrapper, Redis client, etc.) we copy the relevant code into `packages/agent-core/` and adapt it. We pay a duplication cost upfront in exchange for:

- Independent dependency graph — no plugin-server transitive cruft.
- Independent deploy cadence and release process.
- Free hand to delete/restructure without coordinating with CDP.
- Clean ownership boundary for codeowners / on-call.

Cherry-pick what we want, leave the rest. The legacy concepts the agent-stack plan calls out (plugin VMs, worker thread topology, event-pipeline-shaped hooks) don't come with us.

### `packages/agent-core/`

Shared library, no process of its own. Lives here:

- TypeScript types for the session model, manifest, tool protocol, secrets.
- Postgres client(s) — one for the main posthog DB (read app/revision/secret rows; write `AgentSession`/`SandboxInstance` rows), one for the agent-runtime queue DB (jobs). Each package depends on whichever it needs.
- **Queue primitives** — the cyclotron-v2-shaped session queue (see next section). Single `cyclotron_jobs`-style table with `available | running | completed | failed | canceled`, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` dequeue, `lock_id` + `last_heartbeat`, `reschedule({ scheduledAt, state })`, janitor loop. The schema and ops are a clean reimplementation in this package — we own it end-to-end, no shared migrations with `cyclotron_node`.
- Internal-API HTTP client (talks to Django for resolve/decrypt).
- Structured logger, Prom registry, OTel setup.
- Manifest reader / built-ins registry (also imported by the future validator package, so the same code rejects unknown ids in both places).

### `packages/agent-ingress/`

The public-facing process. Responsibilities:

- All `*.agents.posthog.com` traffic terminates here.
- Domain → `(application, revision)` resolution via the Django internal `/internal/agents/applications/resolve` endpoint. In-process LRU keyed by revision id, invalidated on promotion (we expose a small admin endpoint for Django to ping after promote — or just rely on TTL, decide at impl time).
- Per-app auth derived from the resolved revision's config (public / webhook signature / shared secret).
- Implements `/run`, `/listen/:id`, `/send/:id`, `/webhooks/:provider`, `/health`, `/status`. Same contract as the SDK's local dev server.
- `/run` writes an `AgentSession` row + enqueues a session job in the agent-core queue, returns `{ session_id }` immediately.
- `/listen` subscribes to the Redis pub-sub channel `agent_session:{id}` for SSE streaming.
- `/send` publishes a message into `agent_session:{id}:input` — runner picks it up at the next yield.

**Hard rule (matches agent-stack plan):** ingress imports zero Anthropic / Claude Agent SDK / Modal code, and never decrypts a secret. Enforced by an `eslint-plugin-no-restricted-imports` rule in the package. The blast-radius win is the whole point of splitting from the runner.

### `packages/agent-runner/`

The session executor. Responsibilities:

1. Dequeues a session job from the agent-core queue (lock + heartbeat handled by the queue layer).
2. Loads `parsed_manifest` from cached internal-API resolve.
3. Restores Claude Agent SDK state from the job's `state` payload.
4. Runs one "turn" — until the next tool boundary or completion.
5. Two cases:
   - **Completion** → ack the job, write final `output` to `AgentSession`, publish completion to pub-sub.
   - **Suspension** (long-running tool, sandbox call, waiting on `/send`) → `reschedule({ scheduledAt, state: serialized_sdk_state })`. Heartbeats keep ticking while inside a turn so we don't get reaped mid-execution.
6. Streams events to the pub-sub bus throughout.

Tool execution split:

- **Meta tools** — in-process. Trivial.
- **Referenced (built-in) tools** — in-process. Built-ins registry is a hardcoded map in `agent-core` (e.g. `packages/agent-core/src/builtins/index.ts`). The future validator package imports the same map so unknown ids fail before deploy.
- **Local tools** — proxied to a Modal sandbox via the sandbox manager. Per-invocation secrets passed in the call, never persisted in the sandbox.

Sandbox manager:

- Looks up the live `SandboxInstance` row for `(application, revision)`. JIT-provisions on first request.
- Updates `last_used_at` on each call.
- Periodic reaper job (cooperative Postgres advisory lock) destroys sandboxes idle > TTL.

Reaper:

- Runs in the runner process. Two passes per tick:
  1. **Sessions** — the queue janitor resets stalled jobs; we additionally write `AgentSession.state = 'failed'` for any session whose job hit the poison-pill threshold.
  2. **Sandboxes** — described above.

---

## Why cyclotron-v2 — as a concept, not a dependency

A Claude Agent SDK run looks structurally identical to the CDP hog-flow execution model: long-running, stateful, crosses many tool / model-call boundaries, each boundary a natural suspend/resume point, no ordering between concurrent runs, needs lock-based concurrency with heartbeats, needs a janitor for stalled or poisoned jobs.

cyclotron-v2 has solved exactly these problems in production for CDP. We **reimplement the concepts** in `agent-core`, copying the relevant code where it's cheaper than rebuilding, with no runtime dependency on `nodejs/src/cdp/services/cyclotron-v2/` or the `cyclotron_node` schema.

| cyclotron-v2 concept | Agent-core mirror | Reference (for copying) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JobState: available \| running \| completed \| failed \| canceled` | Same enum, drop-in for `AgentSession.state`. | [`rust/cyclotron-core/src/types.rs:10`](../../rust/cyclotron-core/src/types.rs) |
| `lock_id` + `last_heartbeat` + `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` dequeue | Same pattern. Runner owns a session via lock; heartbeats every N seconds while inside an SDK turn. | [`nodejs/src/cdp/services/cyclotron-v2/worker.ts:88`](../../nodejs/src/cdp/services/cyclotron-v2/worker.ts) |
| `state: BYTEA` payload | Persist Claude Agent SDK conversation/turn state between suspensions. | [`rust/cyclotron-node-migrations/20260303000001_initial_schema.sql:9`](../../rust/cyclotron-node-migrations/20260303000001_initial_schema.sql) |
| `reschedule({ scheduledAt, state })` | After every tool boundary, runner reschedules with updated state rather than blocking. | [`nodejs/src/cdp/services/cyclotron-v2/worker.ts:161`](../../nodejs/src/cdp/services/cyclotron-v2/worker.ts) |
| Janitor — stall recovery + poison-pill detection | New daemon inside agent-runner. | [`nodejs/src/cdp/services/cyclotron-v2/janitor.ts`](../../nodejs/src/cdp/services/cyclotron-v2/janitor.ts) |
| `parent_run_id` for batch grouping | Use for "trigger fanout" — one cron firing creates N sessions sharing a parent run id. |  |
| `queue_name` + `priority` | Per-app or per-tier queue isolation. v1 = single queue; schema is open for v2 fairness work. |  |
| `function_id` (UUID) field | Repurpose as `revision_id` for fast lookup of all sessions for a revision (promotion + reaper). |  |

What we add on top:

- **Heartbeat-from-inside-the-SDK.** SDK tool callbacks and Anthropic streaming chunks tick the queue heartbeat.
- **Session event bus.** The queue stores final state, not intermediate frames. SSE streaming lives in a Redis pub-sub keyed by `session_id`. Queue row + final-state blob is the durable record; the bus is best-effort.
- **`AgentSession` mirror in main posthog Postgres.** Queue rows live in the agent-runtime queue DB; the team-scoped mirror row in main posthog Postgres gives us FKs to `Team` / `AgentApplication` / `Revision`, activity log integration, and clean UI queries.

### Queue database

A separate Postgres DB owned by the agent-runtime — `agent_runtime_queue` (name TBD). Schema lives in `packages/agent-core/migrations/`, applied by a small bin script in the same package (mirrors how Rust migrations are managed for `cyclotron_node`, but in TypeScript since we have no Rust here). Not the main posthog Postgres. Not shared with `cyclotron_node`.

## Part A — `products/agents/` Django app

Mirror the [`products/deployments/`](../../products/deployments) scaffold from #58421:

```
products/agents/
  __init__.py
  product.yaml
  manifest.tsx
  package.json
  backend/
    __init__.py
    apps.py
    access.py
    models.py
    api/
    services/
    migrations/
    management/
    test/
  frontend/
  mcp/                  # later
```

Bootstrap with `bin/hogli product:bootstrap agents` per the [Products README](../../products/README.md), then customize.

### Models

All inherit `UUIDModel` ([`posthog/models/utils.py:183`](../../posthog/models/utils.py)) — uuid7 PKs. All tenant-data models have `team_id` (FK to `posthog.Team`) per the CLAUDE.md rule; consider `ProductTeamModel` if the product ends up isolated.

**`AgentApplication`** (team-scoped)

- `team: FK(Team)`, `name`, `slug` (unique — see open Q1), `description`
- `live_revision: FK(Revision, null=True)` — pointer-swap on promotion
- Soft delete (`deleted: bool`)
- Activity-logged via `log_activity_from_viewset` ([`posthog/api/hog_function.py:640`](../../posthog/api/hog_function.py))

**`Revision`** (immutable per deploy)

- `application: FK(AgentApplication)`
- `state: enum(pending_upload | uploaded | validating | ready | failed)` — **full state machine in the schema from day one**, even though v1 skips straight from `uploaded` to `ready` (see §C).
- `bundle_s3_key`, `bundle_size`, `bundle_sha256` — content-hash binding for the presigned PUT.
- `top_level_config: JSONField` — validated synchronously at deploy start by Django.
- `parsed_manifest: JSONField(null=True)` — populated by the future validator package. v1 leaves this null and runner falls back to reading the bundle's `.ass.yaml` manifest section directly via `top_level_config`.
- `validation_report: JSONField(null=True)` — structured errors when the future validator marks `failed`.
- `created_by: FK(User)`, `created_at`
- Index: `(application_id, state, created_at desc)` for "list ready revisions".

**`PreviewBinding`**

- `application: FK(AgentApplication)`, `revision: FK(Revision)`, `subdomain_suffix: str`

**`AgentApplicationSecret`**

- `application: FK(AgentApplication)`, `name: str` (unique per app), `encrypted_value: EncryptedJSONStringField`
- `EncryptedJSONStringField` ([`posthog/helpers/encrypted_fields.py:137`](../../posthog/helpers/encrypted_fields.py)) — same pattern as `Integration.sensitive_config`.
- Plaintext never returned by REST API after creation. Decryption only via internal API, audit-logged per call.

**`AgentSession`** (mirror of queue job in main DB)

- `team: FK(Team)`, `application: FK(AgentApplication)`, `revision: FK(Revision)`
- `queue_job_id: UUID` — points at the actual job in the agent-runtime queue DB
- `state: enum` — mirrors the queue's `JobState`. Updated by the runner on transition.
- `trigger_type: str`, `trigger_payload: JSONField`
- `input: JSONField`, `output: JSONField(null=True)`, `error: JSONField(null=True)`
- `parent_run_id: UUID(null=True)` — same id as the queue's `parent_run_id` for trigger fanouts
- `started_at`, `last_heartbeat_at`, `completed_at`
- `runtime_instance: str(null=True)` — for attribution

**`SandboxInstance`**

- `application: FK(AgentApplication)`, `revision: FK(Revision)`
- `modal_sandbox_id: str`, `state: enum(provisioning | ready | terminating | terminated)`
- `created_at`, `last_used_at`, `terminated_at`
- v1 = at most one per `(application, revision)`. No unique constraint at the DB level; enforced by runtime.

### Migrations

Standard Django migrations under `products/agents/backend/migrations/`. Follow the [`django-migrations`](../../.claude/skills/django-migrations) skill — invoke it before writing the migration files.

### API (DRF + OAuth)

Invoke [`improving-drf-endpoints`](../../.claude/skills/improving-drf-endpoints) before writing viewsets/serializers — it covers `@validated_request`, `@extend_schema`, and the schema/typing pipeline that feeds frontend + MCP.

New scope objects: `agent_application`, `agent_secret`. Add to [`posthog/scopes.py:16`](../../posthog/scopes.py).

Viewsets follow `TeamAndOrgViewSetMixin` + `scope_object` ([`posthog/api/hog_function.py:469`](../../posthog/api/hog_function.py)).

Endpoints (project-scoped `/api/projects/{team_id}/...`):

- `agent_applications/` — CRUD + soft delete
  - `POST /:id/start_deploy` → `{ revision_id, presigned_put_url, expires_at, max_size, required_sha256 }`
  - `POST /:id/complete_upload` → **v1: synchronously transition the revision to `ready`** (skipping `validating`). Logged so we know which revisions never went through real validation when the validator lands.
  - `POST /:id/promote` → swap `live_revision` to a `ready` revision
- `revisions/` — list + retrieve (read-only)
- `preview_bindings/` — CRUD
- `agent_application_secrets/` — create/list/delete (no plaintext read)
- `agent_sessions/` — list + retrieve. Filters: `application_id`, `state`, `parent_run_id`, time range.

**Internal-only endpoints** (called by `agent-ingress` and `agent-runner`):

- `GET /internal/agents/applications/resolve` — given a domain or app id, returns the live revision + manifest. Cacheable ~5s.
- `POST /internal/agents/secrets/{app_id}/decrypt` — returns plaintext for a named set of secrets. Audit-logged. Separate internal scope, not exposed in OAuth UI.

Add to `INTERNAL_API_SCOPE_OBJECTS` ([`posthog/scopes.py:121`](../../posthog/scopes.py)) so they don't appear in PAT creation flows.

### Frontend

Mirror [`products/deployments/manifest.tsx`](../../products/deployments/manifest.tsx). Gated by `FEATURE_FLAGS.AGENTS`, `tags: ['alpha']`.

v1 scenes:

- `AgentApplications` (list)
- `AgentApplication` (detail: revisions, secrets, sessions, sandbox state tabs)
- `AgentSession` (single-session inspection)

Use the [`scene-menu-bar`](../../.claude/skills/scene-menu-bar) and [`making-scenes-tab-aware`](../../.claude/skills/making-scenes-tab-aware) conventions for tabs.

Routes:

- `/agents` → list
- `/agents/:slug` → detail (default: revisions)
- `/agents/:slug/sessions/:session_id` → session detail

CLI is the primary deploy surface in v1; this UI is management + observability.

---

## Part B — Deploy flow (v1, no async validator)

1. CLI bundles the project locally.
2. CLI calls Django `start_deploy` with the parsed top-level config. Django validates synchronously (schema-level checks on `.ass.yaml` and triggers) and creates a `Revision` row in `pending_upload`.
3. Django returns a presigned S3 PUT URL bound to size + content hash.
4. CLI uploads the bundle to S3.
5. CLI calls `complete_upload`.
6. **v1 shortcut**: Django transitions the revision `uploaded → ready` immediately, with no manifest parsing. The bundle is trusted as-is.
7. CLI (or web UI) `promote`s the revision to live.
8. Runtime resolves traffic for the app to the live revision (cache invalidation keyed by revision id).

The full state machine (`pending_upload → uploaded → validating → ready | failed`) is present in the schema and the `complete_upload` endpoint; the `validating → ready` transition is just immediate in v1. When the validator package lands, `complete_upload` stops auto-promoting and instead enqueues a validation job in a separate queue.

---

## Part C — Async bundle validator (deferred, not v1)

When we ship it, the validator will be **a fourth node package**, not a Celery task. Lives at `packages/agent-validator/`. Same shape as `agent-runner`:

- Polls its own work queue (`available` revisions whose state is `uploaded` / `validating`).
- Picks one up, marks `validating`, streams the bundle from S3, unpacks with size/file-count caps, walks manifests, resolves referenced ids against the shared built-ins registry in `agent-core`, runs static checks (secrets exist, allow-listed actions exist on referenced tools, triggers valid), transitions to `ready` (+ `parsed_manifest`) or `failed` (+ structured `validation_report`).
- Same heartbeat/lock/janitor pattern from `agent-core`'s queue primitives — the validator is just another consumer of the same primitive, against a different table.
- Built-ins registry shared via `agent-core` means the validator and the runner have identical opinions on which tool ids exist.

v1 ships without it. Models support the state transitions today; the runner reads `top_level_config` directly until `parsed_manifest` is being populated. When the validator lands:

- `complete_upload` stops auto-promoting.
- Existing revisions stay `ready` (they were trusted).
- Validator starts running for new revisions.
- Runner switches to preferring `parsed_manifest` when present.

Pure-function validators (`(bytes) -> (parsed, errors)`) inside the validator package will also be importable by the CLI for `ass build` local checks.

---

## Part D — Security & infra

- **DBs**:
  - Agent-runtime queue gets its own Postgres DB (`agent_runtime_queue`). Not shared with `cyclotron_node`. Owned by `agent-core` migrations.
  - `AgentSession` and `SandboxInstance` mirrors live in main posthog Postgres (team-scoped, FKs, activity log eligible).
  - Runner writes to both — queue row is the work item, `AgentSession` is the user-visible record.
- **S3 bucket**: new `posthog-agent-bundles-{env}`, KMS-encrypted, lifecycle expires non-`ready` bundles after 7 days. Use [`posthog/storage/object_storage.py:33`](../../posthog/storage/object_storage.py) helpers from Django.
- **Secrets**: `EncryptedJSONStringField` (same key schedule as `Integration`). Decrypt only in `agent-runner` via the internal API.
- **Per-team quotas**: enforced on Django writes (apps, secrets, revisions/day) and at `agent-ingress` (concurrent sessions per app, `/run` rate limit). Surface limits in the UI.
- **Observability**: structured logs with `app_id` / `revision_id` / `session_id` / `queue_job_id`; OTel traces per session and per tool call; Prometheus metrics; Sentry tagged separately for `agent-ingress` and `agent-runner`.
- **Feature flag**: `FEATURE_FLAGS.AGENTS` gates the product (frontend + API + ingress). Per-team rollout.

---

## Open questions

Resolutions to the agent-stack open questions + posthog-specific ones:

1. **Slug uniqueness** — global. Subdomain-driven; per-team would need a tenant prefix we don't want.
2. **API ↔ worker transport** — the agent-core queue (cyclotron-v2-shaped, in its own DB). Closed.
3. **Built-ins registry visibility** — shared from `agent-core` so the future validator and the runner agree from day one.
4. **Cluster placement** — `agent-ingress` and `agent-runner` are their own k8s deployments with their own HPAs. Sized independently.
5. **Queue DB sharing** — `agent_runtime_queue` is its own DB. No sharing with `cyclotron_node` or main posthog.
6. **Queue state size cap** — Claude Agent SDK conversation state can grow large. Need a soft cap (e.g. 1 MiB) and a fallback that offloads the conversation log to S3, keeping only a pointer in the job state. Validate against a real workload before promising a number.
7. **Internal-API auth between runtime and Django** — mTLS via existing service mesh, or a shared signing key checked in middleware? Pick at impl time.
8. **Activity log for sessions** — log only management-plane changes (apps, revisions, secrets). Sessions are too high-volume; surface them in the sessions UI instead.
9. **Code duplication strategy** — when copying from `nodejs/`, do we vendor whole files with attribution, or rewrite from scratch with the original as reference? Recommend: rewrite small primitives, vendor + adapt larger ones (the queue ops are the only obvious "vendor" candidate).

---

## Milestones (posthog-side)

Each shippable behind `FEATURE_FLAGS.AGENTS`.

1. **Scaffold + models.** `products/agents/` skeleton (mirror `products/deployments/`), Django app, models with the **full state machine in the schema**, migrations. New scope entries. UI stub. *(unblocks parallel work)*
2. **Management API.** CRUD viewsets for apps/revisions/secrets/preview-bindings. Activity logging wired. `complete_upload` shortcut transitions straight to `ready`.
3. **Deploy flow.** `start_deploy` → presigned PUT → `complete_upload` (auto-ready) → `promote`. End-to-end via CLI. No async work.
4. **Internal API.** `resolve` + `decrypt` endpoints with internal scopes. mTLS / signed-key auth.
5. **`packages/agent-core/`.** Types, DB clients, queue primitives (schema + ops), pub-sub helper, internal-API client, logger/metrics. No process; tested in isolation.
6. **`packages/agent-ingress/`.** Domain resolution, `/run` writes `AgentSession` + enqueues job, `/listen` SSE wired to pub-sub, `/send` publishes to pub-sub. Runner stubbed.
7. **`packages/agent-runner/` — meta + built-in tools.** Queue consumer. Real Claude Agent SDK invocation. State serialized into queue `state`, reschedule loop on tool boundaries. Built-ins registry shared with `agent-core`.
8. **Sandboxes.** Modal integration, custom-tool execution, sandbox lifecycle + reaper. `SandboxInstance` writes from the runner.
9. **Triggers.** Webhooks, cron, slack event ingestion.
10. **Frontend.** App list, app detail (revisions/secrets/sessions/sandbox tabs), session detail.
11. **Preview deploys, observability polish, quotas.**
12. **`packages/agent-validator/`.** Async bundle validator. Pure-function checks reusable from the CLI. Flip `complete_upload` to enqueue validation instead of auto-ready.
13. **Skills + registry v2** (publish flow, third-party tool publishing). Reuses the same Revision-style immutable artifacts.
