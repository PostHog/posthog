# Marketing source suggestions

Marketing analytics suggests connecting an ad platform when a matching UTM source has events with paid attribution signals.
Connection suggestions display the number of these events over the last seven days and rank platforms by that count.
Events without paid signals and fuzzy-only source matches do not increase the count.
Each event counts at most once for its matched platform, even if it carries multiple paid signals.

The count includes all matching event types, so it does not represent unique visitors or ad clicks.
For example, a source with 700 matching events, including 17 with paid signals, shows 17 events in its connection suggestion.
It ranks below a source with 25 paid events, regardless of that source's total traffic.

These counts guide connection suggestions; they do not change report attribution or connected-source sync checks.
