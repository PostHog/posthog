# Report completion and late PR attachments

A report completes after all linked implementation PRs are closed or merged.
At least one merged PR resolves the report; otherwise all closed PRs suppress it.

Attaching a new open, draft, or unknown PR to a resolved report returns it to ready.
The shared PR-linking service applies this rule to task outputs and agent attachments.
An existing attachment retry does not reopen a report, and importing legacy assignments preserves its status.
Suppressed reports remain suppressed when another PR is attached.

## Fix verification notes

After research completes, actionable reports can include a `Steps to verify fix` note for the implementation agent.
This final request is optional: if generation or note conversion fails, research still completes without the note.
The findings, actionability, priority, title, and summary remain available.
Core research failures and cancellation still fail the run and trigger session cleanup.
