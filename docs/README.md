# PostHog Documentation in Monorepo

This directory contains developer-focused documentation that has been migrated from `posthog.com` into the `posthog` monorepo. This enables engineers to update docs alongside code in a single PR.

## Quick Start

- **For Published Docs** - See `./published/README.md`
- **For Internal Docs** - See `./internal/README.md`
- **Full Migration Plan** - See `./DOCS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- **Build Guide** - See `./MONOREPO_DOCS_BUILD_GUIDE.md` (for posthog.com team)

## Publishing Flow

```
Engineer commits to feature branch
    â†“
Push to GitHub
    â†“
PR created with /docs/** changes
    â†“
GitHub Action triggers preview build
    â†“
posthog.com builds from feature branch

## For Monorepo Engineers

When updating these docs:
1. Edit files in `published/` or `internal/` as appropriate
2. Test locally if possible
3. Include doc updates in your feature PR
4. Reviewers can preview on posthog.com
5. Docs go live with code on merge

## For posthog.com Team

The build setup requires:
1. Configuring gatsby to read from `/docs/published/`
2. Adding GitHub Action to trigger preview builds
3. Filtering out `/docs/internal/` from builds

See `MONOREPO_DOCS_BUILD_GUIDE.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Next Steps

This is Phase 1 of the docs migration. Testing PoC workflow with preview builds.

Planned for future phases:

- [ ] Verify build pipeline works with preview docs
- [ ] Move additional engineering handbook sections
- [ ] Move more operational runbooks
- [ ] Document cross-repo link strategy
- [ ] Set up redirects for deprecated posthog.com docs

## FAQ

**Q: Can I create docs in `/docs/internal/` even if not published?**
A: Yes! Internal docs stay in the repo with code and are searchable on GitHub. Perfect for internal-only content.

**Q: How do I test published docs locally?**
A: Set `POSTHOG_REPO_PATH` and run posthog.com locally. See MONOREPO_DOCS_BUILD_GUIDE.md.

**Q: What format should docs use?**
A: Same as posthog.com - Markdown/MDX with YAML frontmatter. Copy from existing docs for consistency.

**Q: When should I move a doc here vs keep it in posthog.com?**
A: Docs about PostHog internals and architecture â†’ here. User product docs and tutorials â†’ posthog.com.

**Q: How do I link between published docs?**
A: Use relative paths: `../contributing/index.md` or `./index.md`
