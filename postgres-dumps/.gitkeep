# This directory contains pre-migrated PostgreSQL database dump
# 
# To generate/update the dump:
#   1. Clean your local database: dropdb posthog posthog_persons behavioral_cohorts cyclotron
#   2. Run: bin/generate-pre-migrated-dump
#   3. Commit the generated dump file: git add postgres-dumps/pre-migrated.sql.gz
#
# The dump will be automatically used in tests and CI as a fast starting point.
# Migrations will still run after restore to apply any new migrations.
