There are many ways to contribute to PostHog. We want to help developers know exactly how users are interacting with their stuff, in a way that doesn't send data to 3rd parties.

# Creating a PR

Just create a new pull request if you want to make an update.

For now, please request Tim (tim@posthog.com) to do the QA.

If you want to speak to us before doing lots of work, just email hey@posthog.com - we're very responsive and friendly!

# Issues

Spotted a bug? Has deployment gone wrong? Do you have user feedback? Raise an issue for the fastest response.

... or pick up and fix an issue if you want to do a Pull Request.

# Feature requests

Raise an issue for these and tag it as an Enhancement. We love every idea. Please give us as much context on the why as possible.

# Features

We don't, yet, have a prescriptive roadmap laid out.

As a rule of thumb - if it fits with helping developers understand product usage, we'll generally like it.

If you are at all unsure, just raise it as an enhancement issue first, and we'll very quickly respond.
