        "video_description": "The user begins in an empty \"Default project\" dashboard displaying a spinner, then navigates the left-hand menu. They click \"Web analytics,\" which loads a page indicating \"This project has no events yet\" and shows all metrics (Visitors, Page views, Sessions, Session duration, Bounce rate) as zero. A message states, \"We couldn't find any authorized domains.\" The user then clicks \"Session replay,\" which loads a page welcoming them to session replay but shows \"No recording selected\" and \"No matching recordings\" in the filter panel. Next, they click \"Error tracking,\" where the page indicates, \"You haven't captured any exceptions\" and prompts to enable exception autocapture. The user then clicks \"Surveys,\" which displays a message about creating the first survey and \"Surveys are currently disabled.\" Finally, the user returns to \"Session replay,\" which again displays \"No matching recordings\" and an orange message stating, \"Recordings might be outside the retention period: Recordings: 0.\" Throughout this navigation, no data is displayed in any of the visited sections, and no explicit error messages indicating a blocking exception are observed."
