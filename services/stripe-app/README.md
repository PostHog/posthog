# PostHog Stripe App

A [Stripe App](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps) that surfaces PostHog product analytics data
directly inside the Stripe Dashboard.

## Architecture

### Double OAuth flow

Connecting PostHog to Stripe requires **two** OAuth exchanges in sequence:

1. **Stripe OAuth** (Stripe → PostHog):
   the user clicks "Connect" in PostHog,
   which redirects them to `marketplace.stripe.com/oauth/v2/authorize`.
   Stripe asks the user to grant PostHog access to their Stripe account.
   On success Stripe redirects back to PostHog with an authorization code
   that PostHog exchanges for a Stripe access token.
   This token is stored in the PostHog `Integration` model (`sensitive_config.access_token`)
   and is used server-side for data imports and for writing secrets to Stripe.

2. **PostHog OAuth** (PostHog → Stripe Secret Store):
   immediately after the Stripe token exchange,
   the PostHog backend creates a PostHog OAuth access + refresh token pair
   (scoped to the team) and writes them — along with the region (`us`/`eu`) —
   into Stripe's Secret Store via the Stripe API.
   The Stripe App reads these secrets at runtime to call PostHog APIs.

The three secrets stored in Stripe are:

| Secret name             | Value                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `posthog_region`        | `us` or `eu`                   |
| `posthog_access_token`  | `Bearer` + PostHog OAuth token |
| `posthog_refresh_token` | PostHog OAuth refresh          |

`posthog_access_token` stores the full HTTP `Authorization` header value
(`Bearer <token>`). The Stripe Scripts egress used by the Custom Workflow
Action extension (`extensions/trigger_workflow/`) injects secret payloads
verbatim as header values, with no `Bearer` template — so we persist the
full header string. The UI-extension code in `src/posthog/auth.ts` strips the
prefix on load so the rest of the Node client sees the raw token.

### PostHog backend

Key files:

- `posthog/models/integration.py` — `StripeIntegration` class: writes and clears secrets in Stripe
- `posthog/api/integration.py` — triggers `write_posthog_secrets()` after Stripe OAuth callback
- `posthog/settings/integrations.py` — env vars (`STRIPE_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `STRIPE_APP_SECRET_KEY`,
  `STRIPE_POSTHOG_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `STRIPE_APP_OVERRIDE_AUTHORIZE_URL`)

### Stripe App (this directory)

- `src/posthog/auth.ts` — reads/writes/clears credentials in Stripe's Secret Store
- `src/posthog/client.ts` — authenticated HTTP client for PostHog APIs
- `src/components/PostHogConnect.tsx` — connection status UI + dev-mode token entry
- `src/views/` — Stripe Dashboard view entry points (Home, Settings, Onboarding)
- `src/constants.ts` — typed access to manifest constants (PostHog URLs)
- `extensions/trigger_workflow/` — Stripe Workflows Custom Action that fires a PostHog workflow
  (Script implementation calling the public webhook URL)

### Manifest files

- `stripe-app.json` — production manifest: PostHog URLs, permissions, CSP.
- `stripe-app.dev.json` — extends the production manifest, overrides URLs to `localhost:8010`.
- `stripe-app.yaml` — Manifest v2 entry that holds only the
  Stripe Workflows `extensions:` block. Per the Stripe Extensions private
  preview spec, the v2 YAML coexists with `stripe-app.json` rather than
  replacing it.

Manifest v2 requires the Stripe CLI apps plugin v1.15.5 or later. The `APP_MANIFEST_VERSION_TWO=true`
environment variable is already baked into the `dev` and `upload`
scripts in `package.json`, so nothing extra is needed when running them
via `pnpm --filter=@posthog/stripe dev` / `pnpm --filter=@posthog/stripe upload`.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) installed and authenticated (`stripe login`)
- PostHog running locally on `localhost:8010`

### Running the app locally

You can configure phrocs to include the stripe app in your configuration when running `hogli dev:setup`. If you don't wanna change your phrocs setup, however, you can run it manually

```bash
# Via hogli (recommended — also starts via phrocs)
hogli start:stripe:app

# Or directly
pnpm --filter=@posthog/stripe dev
```

This runs `APP_MANIFEST_VERSION_TWO=true stripe apps start --manifest stripe-app.dev.json`,
which serves the app UI inside the Stripe Dashboard in test mode.

### Connecting to PostHog locally

There are two approaches depending on whether you need to test the OAuth flow itself.

#### Quick approach: paste tokens from the startup logs

The dev server automatically generates PostHog OAuth tokens on startup
(via `manage.py generate_stripe_app_tokens`).
You'll see the tokens printed in the logs when the server starts — no manual command needed.

The tokens are reused across restarts as long as they haven't expired (24 hours).
If you need fresh ones, run the command manually with `--force`:

```bash
python manage.py generate_stripe_app_tokens --team-id=1 --force
```

On first run, if `STRIPE_POSTHOG_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` is not set,
the command will automatically create an `OAuthApplication`
and write its `client_id` to your `.env`.

To connect the app:

1. Look for the token output in the dev server logs (or phrocs `stripe-app` pane).
2. In the Stripe Dashboard, navigate to the PostHog app
   (it runs in test mode when started via `stripe apps start`).
   The "Not connected" screen shows a **Dev mode** section at the bottom
   with fields for region, access token, and refresh token.
3. Paste the values and click **Save tokens**.

The app stores them in Stripe's Secret Store just like the production flow would,
and the connection is established.

By default the startup script uses team ID 1.
Pass a different ID as an argument: `bin/start-stripe-app 42`.

#### Full approach: test the complete OAuth flow

If you need to test the actual double OAuth exchange end-to-end,
you need to work around the fact that Stripe's OAuth redirect cannot target `localhost`.
The trick is to temporarily route through a production URL and then redirect back locally.

1. **Set up environment variables** in your `.env`:

   ```bash
   STRIPE_APP_CLIENT_ID=ca_...           # from Stripe Apps dashboard
   STRIPE_APP_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...     # from Stripe API keys
   STRIPE_POSTHOG_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...   # auto-created by the management command, or create manually
   STRIPE_APP_OVERRIDE_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://marketplace.stripe.com/oauth/v2/chnlink_.../authorize
   ```

   The `STRIPE_APP_OVERRIDE_AUTHORIZE_URL` must be a channel link URL
   (not the standard marketplace URL) because channel links allow
   non-published app versions to be installed.

2. **Start the OAuth flow** from PostHog (localhost:8010).
   PostHog redirects to Stripe's authorize page.

3. **Stripe redirects back** to the `redirect_uri` — which is derived from `SITE_URL`
   and will be `https://localhost:8010/integrations/stripe/callback`
   (or `https://us.posthog.com/...` if that's your `SITE_URL`).

   Since Stripe requires HTTPS redirect URIs,
   and `localhost` doesn't have a valid HTTPS certificate,
   you have two options:

   a. **Temporarily set `SITE_URL` to a production URL** (e.g. `https://us.posthog.com`),
   start the OAuth flow, then once Stripe redirects to that production URL,
   copy the callback URL from the browser, change the host to `localhost:8010`,
   and paste it into your browser to complete the flow locally.

   b. **Use a tunnel** (e.g. ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel) to expose your local PostHog
   on a public HTTPS URL and set `SITE_URL` to that URL.

4. **PostHog completes the exchange**: exchanges the authorization code for a Stripe access token,
   creates PostHog OAuth tokens, and writes all three secrets to Stripe's Secret Store.

The full approach is more involved but tests the entire production flow.
For day-to-day development, the quick approach is recommended.

### Uploading

```bash
cd services/stripe-app
pnpm run upload
```

This creates a `package-lock.json` (required by Stripe) and uploads the app.
