# Code Review: feat/pd/zd-ur

## Critical Issues

- **None identified** — No critical blocking issues found in this changeset.

## Functional Gaps

- **L648-681: Missing error handling in SQL query** — The new `get_teams_with_zero_duration_recording_count_in_period` function doesn't handle potential ClickHouse query failures beyond the retry decorator. Consider adding explicit error handling similar to other query functions.
  
  ```diff
  def get_teams_with_zero_duration_recording_count_in_period(begin: datetime, end: datetime) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:
      previous_begin = begin - (end - begin)
  +   try:
          result = sync_execute(
              """...""",
              {"previous_begin": previous_begin, "begin": begin, "end": end},
              workload=Workload.OFFLINE,
              settings=CH_BILLING_SETTINGS,
          )
  +   except Exception as e:
  +       logger.error("Failed to fetch zero duration recordings", error=str(e))
  +       return []
      return result
  ```

- **Missing test coverage for edge cases** — While tests cover the basic zero-duration scenario, consider adding:
  - Test case for recordings that span exactly midnight boundary  
  - Test case for concurrent zero-duration recordings from same session
  - Test case when ClickHouse query fails/times out

## Improvements Suggested

- **L653-654: Clarify time calculation logic** — The `previous_begin` calculation assumes equal period lengths. Add a comment explaining this assumption.
  
  ```diff
  + # Calculate the start of the previous period by subtracting the period duration
  + # This ensures we exclude sessions that may have started before the current period
    previous_begin = begin - (end - begin)
  ```

- **L660-664: Optimize SQL query performance** — The nested subquery with `NOT IN` can be expensive for large datasets. Consider using a LEFT JOIN with NULL check for better performance:
  
  ```sql
  WITH zero_duration_sessions AS (
      SELECT any(team_id) as team_id, session_id
      FROM session_replay_events
      WHERE min_first_timestamp >= %(begin)s AND min_first_timestamp < %(end)s
      GROUP BY session_id
      HAVING dateDiff('milliseconds', min(min_first_timestamp), max(max_last_timestamp)) = 0
  ),
  previous_sessions AS (
      SELECT DISTINCT session_id
      FROM session_replay_events
      WHERE min_first_timestamp >= %(previous_begin)s AND min_first_timestamp < %(begin)s
  )
  SELECT z.team_id, count(distinct z.session_id) as count
  FROM zero_duration_sessions z
  LEFT JOIN previous_sessions p ON z.session_id = p.session_id
  WHERE p.session_id IS NULL
  GROUP BY z.team_id
  ```

- **L102: Parameterize test duration** — The test helper `_setup_replay_data` hardcodes a 1-second duration. Consider making this configurable:
  
  ```diff
  - def _setup_replay_data(team_id: int, include_mobile_replay: bool, include_zero_duration: bool = False) -> None:
  + def _setup_replay_data(team_id: int, include_mobile_replay: bool, include_zero_duration: bool = False, duration_seconds: int = 1) -> None:
      ...
  -    last_timestamp=timestamp + timedelta(seconds=1),
  +    last_timestamp=timestamp + timedelta(seconds=duration_seconds),
  ```

- **Test class naming consistency** — The test class rename from `UsageReport` to `TestUsageReport` (and others) improves consistency with pytest conventions, but ensure all test discovery tools are updated.

## Positive Observations

- **Good test coverage** — Comprehensive tests added for the new zero-duration recording functionality, including both unit tests and integration with org report aggregation
- **Consistent patterns** — New function follows established patterns in the codebase (decorators, retry logic, workload specification)
- **Backward compatibility** — Changes are additive; existing functionality remains intact with new field defaulting to 0
- **Performance consideration** — Uses appropriate ClickHouse settings (`CH_BILLING_SETTINGS`) and workload classification (`Workload.OFFLINE`)
- **Clear SQL logic** — The HAVING clause correctly identifies zero-duration sessions using millisecond precision

## Overall Assessment

**Approve** — The implementation adds valuable zero-duration recording tracking capability with good test coverage. Address the suggested performance optimization for the SQL query before deployment to production, especially if dealing with high-volume recording data. Consider adding error handling for resilience.

**Next steps:**
1. Add explicit error handling to the new ClickHouse query function
2. Monitor query performance in staging environment with production-scale data
