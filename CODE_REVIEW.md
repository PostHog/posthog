## Critical Issues

**None identified.** The implementation handles security, data integrity, and error cases appropriately.

## Functional Gaps

### Missing Test Coverage
• **L321-600 in max_tools.py:** `SurveyAnalysisTool` needs more edge case tests:
  - Test for surveys with no questions (`questions=[]`)
  - Test for malformed context data (invalid survey_id format)
  - Test for concurrent analysis requests
  - Test names to add: `test_survey_analysis_empty_questions`, `test_survey_analysis_invalid_survey_id`, `test_survey_analysis_concurrent_requests`

• **Frontend integration tests missing:** No tests verify the Max button appearance logic or the data formatting pipeline from frontend to backend

### Error Handling Improvements
• **L456-469 in max_tools.py:** Error capture masks all exceptions generically. Consider categorizing errors:

```diff
- except Exception as e:
-     capture_exception(e, {"team_id": self._team.id, "user_id": self._user.id})
-     error_message = f"❌ Survey analysis failed: {str(e)}"
+ except orjson.JSONDecodeError as e:
+     capture_exception(e, {"team_id": self._team.id, "user_id": self._user.id, "error_type": "json_parse"})
+     error_message = "❌ Survey analysis failed: Unable to parse analysis results"
+ except Exception as e:
+     capture_exception(e, {"team_id": self._team.id, "user_id": self._user.id, "error_type": "unknown"})
+     error_message = f"❌ Survey analysis failed: {str(e)}"
```

### Type Safety Gap
• **L339-376 in max_tools.py:** The backward compatibility handling for dict → typed format should have explicit type validation:

```diff
  for response in group.get("responses", []):
      if isinstance(response, dict):
+         # Validate required fields exist
+         if "responseText" not in response:
+             continue  # Skip malformed responses
          responses_data.append(
              SurveyAnalysisResponseItem(
```

## Improvements Suggested

### Performance Optimization
• **L412-430 in max_tools.py:** Consider caching LLM responses for identical survey data to reduce API calls and costs. Add a short-lived cache (15 minutes) keyed by survey_id + response hash.

### Code Organization
• **L140-301 in prompts.py:** The `SURVEY_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is 161 lines. Consider extracting examples into a separate constant for better maintainability:

```python
SURVEY_ANALYSIS_EXAMPLES = {...}
SURVEY_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""...{SURVEY_ANALYSIS_EXAMPLES}..."""
```

### User Experience
• **L497-546 in max_tools.py:** The formatted output could benefit from response volume thresholds - warn users if analyzing < 10 responses might not yield meaningful insights.

### Test Data Detection Enhancement
• **L156-159 in prompts.py:** The test data detection logic could be enhanced with more patterns:
  - Consecutive keyboard patterns (e.g., "qwerty", "zxcv")
  - Repeated characters (e.g., "aaaa", "1111")
  - Common test emails (e.g., "test@test.com", patterns like "user[0-9]+@example.com")

### Documentation
• **Missing inline documentation:** Key methods like `_extract_open_ended_responses` and `_format_responses_for_llm` would benefit from examples in docstrings showing expected input/output format.

## Positive Observations

• **Excellent test coverage:** Comprehensive test suite with 560+ lines covering happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
• **Strong type safety:** Proper TypeScript types (`SurveyAnalysisData`) with frontend-backend consistency via schema generation
• **Smart anti-hallucination design:** Clear instructions in prompts to detect and handle test data appropriately
• **Feature flag protection:** Safe rollout with `SURVEY_ANALYSIS_MAX_TOOL` flag
• **Good error boundaries:** Graceful fallbacks throughout with user-friendly error messages
• **Clean separation of concerns:** Well-structured with separate prompt files and clear tool boundaries
• **Backward compatibility:** Thoughtful handling of transition from untyped to typed data structures

## Overall Assessment

**Approve** ✅

This is a well-architected feature addition that thoughtfully integrates AI-powered survey analysis into PostHog. The code demonstrates strong engineering practices with comprehensive testing, proper error handling, and safe rollout mechanisms.

**Next Steps:**
1. Add the suggested edge case tests for complete coverage
2. Consider implementing response caching to optimize costs for repeated analyses

The implementation successfully solves a real user problem (extracting insights from open-ended feedback at scale) with appropriate safeguards against common pitfalls like test data and hallucination. Ready to merge after addressing the minor test coverage gaps.
