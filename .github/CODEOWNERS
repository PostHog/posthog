# If a file is set here, then PRs will require that team's approval to get that code merged.

# WE DO NOT USE CODEOWNERS FOR MANAGING ORDINARY RISK.

# Risk of outages, incidents, and operational difficulty
# are not sufficient reason to add a region of the codebase
# to the CODEOWNERS file. Handle these by de-risking your
# code, or by modifying CI to suit your products needs.

# Adding entries to the codeowners file is an anti-social
# and anti-posthog-values thing to do. It must have extraordinary
# justification. If you are not _certain_ there is _no other way_
# to manage the risk you're thinking about, do not add an entry.
