name: GitHub Codespaces image build

# Run only on master branch. We could also build on branch but this seems like
# an optimization that can be done as and when desired. The main use case we're
# handling is creating and working off a branch from master, so it doesn't seem
# like an immediate requirement to have branches as well.
#
# NOTE: the job is setup to also push branch images as well, and using branch
# and master as caching, so if we want to add the optimisation for branches we
# can just remove the master branch restriction.
