# This workflow previously existed and was compromised. This placeholder file
# exists to allow blocking this workflow name in GitHub's branch protection rules.
#
# This prevents anyone from:
# 1. Using a cached/previous version of a workflow with this name
# 2. Re-creating a malicious workflow using this known-compromised name

# If you need to create an auto-assign reviewers workflow, please use a
# different name and workflow file
