# NOTE: We use `pull_request_target` here but this is extremely dangerous.
# DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MODIFY THIS FILE WITHOUT VALIDATING WITH THE SECURITY TEAM.
#
# We need to make sure we're never running untrusted code here since this workflow
# skips any GitHub security checks and any permissions - it'll always run when a user opens a PR against our repo.
# To make it risk free we need to GUARANTEE we're only ever running code that is trusted - i.e. from our master branch.
#
# This has the small downside that changes to CODEOWNERS will not be reflected in here until we merge it to master,
# which means testing this workflow is slightly less convenient but that's well worth it.
