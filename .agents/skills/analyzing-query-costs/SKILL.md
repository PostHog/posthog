# Analyzing ClickHouse query costs

Fleet-wide **dollar cost** analysis: what querying costs, who and what drives it, and where the waste is.
Before running SQL, read [`querying-posthog-data`](../../../products/posthog_ai/skills/querying-posthog-data/SKILL.md) and use `posthog:execute-sql` (or the equivalent SQL tool exposed by the current agent runtime). Select the internal "PostHog App + Website" project (project 2 on US Cloud) explicitly; do not assume the runtime's default project is correct.
The sibling skill [`generating-clickhouse-query-performance-reports`](../generating-clickhouse-query-performance-reports/SKILL.md) is the _performance_ lens (slow queries, OOMs, root causes) over the raw `posthog.query_log_archive` via Metabase; use that when the question is "why is X slow" rather than "what does X cost".

**Internal-only.** Results contain cross-customer identifiers, org names, and MRR.
Reports built from this data must never be committed to the public posthog repo, pasted into public PRs, or uploaded to public asset stores.
Write them to a temp folder or a private location and link from there.

## Data sources

Two warehouse tables in project 2, one per region — they are **separate tables; there is no combined view**:

```sql
FROM query_log_archive_us   -- US cluster
FROM query_log_archive_eu   -- EU cluster
```

Properties that differ from the raw `posthog.query_log_archive` documented in the sibling skill — both save you filters:

- **One row per query, initial queries only.** Row types are `QueryFinish`, `ExceptionWhileProcessing`, `ExceptionBeforeStart`. There are no `QueryStart` rows and no non-initial (distributed sub-query) rows, so `count()` is a true query count and **no `is_initial_query` filter is needed**.
- **Multi-month retention** (the raw table keeps ~3 weeks). The example dates below are observations, not guarantees — always start by checking current coverage:

```sql
SELECT min(event_date), max(event_date) FROM query_log_archive_us WHERE event_date >= '2026-01-01'
```

Columns: same `lc_*` scheme as the sibling skill (`team_id`, `lc_kind`, `lc_product`, `lc_feature`, `lc_query_type`, `lc_access_method`, `lc_chargeable`, `lc_temporal__workflow_type`, `lc_dagster__job_name`, `lc_org_id`, `exception_name`, ...), plus typed `ProfileEvents_*` counters.
Discover the live list via `system.information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'query_log_archive_us'`.
Related tables also exist in project 2 (`query_log`, `raw_query_log`, `skinny_query_log`, `*_initial_only`) — verify their scope before relying on them; the two warehouse tables above are the proven path.

## Cost model

```sql
sum(read_bytes)/1e9 * {read_usd_per_gb}                                       -- $ per GB read
  + sum(ProfileEvents_OSCPUVirtualTimeMicroseconds)/1e6 * {cpu_usd_per_sec}   -- $ per CPU-second
  AS cost_usd
```

The two unit rates are internal amortized-infra estimates and are deliberately **not committed to this public repo** — get the current values from the requester (or the owner of the infra cost model) and substitute them into `{read_usd_per_gb}` / `{cpu_usd_per_sec}` before running.
In practice **read bytes dominate the modeled cost**, so scan volume is the number that matters; CPU rarely changes a ranking.

## Workflow

1. **Check coverage, pick the window.** Derive dates from the coverage query at run time. Default to the last 30 _complete_ days covered by both regions. For partial months compare cost **per day**, never month totals.
2. **Totals per region** — the denominator every share is computed against.
3. **One dimension at a time**, coarse → fine: `user` (CH user), `lc_kind` × `lc_workload`, `lc_product` × `lc_feature` (the canonical disjoint view), then `lc_temporal__workflow_type` / `lc_dagster__job_name` for the background buckets.
4. **Daily trend by bucket** (`multiIf` on the top buckets) — separates one-off backfills from steady load from _growing_ load. This changes recommendations more than any other query.
5. **Attribution**: per-team → org → MRR joins (below); concentration ("top N orgs = X% of total"), free vs paying split, top free orgs.
6. **Waste**: failed-query cost by `exception_name`; attribute `TOO_MANY_BYTES` to buckets/teams — repeated kills in one bucket from few teams = a retry loop burning money.
7. **Access**: `lc_access_method` × `lc_chargeable` (is heavy API traffic billed? what does `sharing_token` — public embeds — cost?).

[`references/canned-queries.md`](references/canned-queries.md) contains the runnable totals query plus assembly templates for the remaining steps. Expand each template from the documented two-region UNION before executing it.

## Combining regions and joining to billing

**Union pattern** — the only way to query both regions at once.
Each branch needs its own date filter, and the inner SELECT must include every column referenced anywhere outside (HogQL resolves outer references against the subquery's projection):

```sql
FROM (
    SELECT 'us' AS region, team_id, read_bytes, ProfileEvents_OSCPUVirtualTimeMicroseconds
    FROM query_log_archive_us
    WHERE event_date >= '<window-start>' AND event_date < '<window-end>'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'eu' AS region, team_id, read_bytes, ProfileEvents_OSCPUVirtualTimeMicroseconds
    FROM query_log_archive_eu
    WHERE event_date >= '<window-start>' AND event_date < '<window-end>'
)
```

**Attribution joins** (warehouse views in project 2):

- `all_posthog_team` — `id`, `app_region` (lowercase `'us'` / `'eu'`), `organization_id`, `name`. **Team ids collide across regions**: always join on `(id, app_region)` against a `(team_id, region)` pair; label regions lowercase in the union so they match directly.
- `accounts_replacement_v2` — one row per org: `organization_id`, `name`, `mrr`, `customer_stage`, Stripe fields. `mrr > 0` = paying; treat everything else as free (orgs fully on credits may look free — caveat it).
- `abe_org_to_team_hashmap` — simpler US-only team→org alternative.

Attribution facts that cost time if you don't know them:

- **`lc_org_id` is blank on most background-path cost** (roughly half of total). Never aggregate by `lc_org_id` for attribution — always go `team_id` + region → `all_posthog_team` → org.
- `team_id = 0` / NULL is infra: backfills, usage reports + quota limiting, monitoring, health checks. Break it out as its own bucket, don't drop it.
- Exclude PostHog's own org from customer rankings: `organization_id = '4dc8564d-bd82-1065-2f40-97f7c50f67cf'` — report it as "internal dogfooding".
- Teams missing from `all_posthog_team` are deleted teams; historically negligible cost, bucket as unknown.

## Interpretation traps

- **The attribution taxonomies overlap — never sum across lenses.** `lc_kind`/`lc_workload`, `lc_product`×`lc_feature`, and `lc_temporal__workflow_type`/`lc_dagster__job_name` are different lenses over the _same rows_. Example: error-tracking fingerprint-embedding queries appear as `lc_product='internal', lc_feature='management_command'` _and_ as the `error-tracking-fingerprint-embedding-result` temporal workflow — one workload, two lenses. Pick `lc_product` × `lc_feature` as the canonical disjoint breakdown and use the others as drill-downs.
- **`lc_name` / `lc_id` are usually blank for `management_command` rows.** Identify those workloads via `lc_query_type` (e.g. `ErrorTrackingFingerprintEmbeddingResultClosestFingerprints`) and the `lc_temporal__*` columns instead.
- **Exception rows carry real cost** (`ExceptionWhileProcessing` reads before dying) and are inside every bucket total. Report failed-query cost as an overlapping slice, not an additive bucket. `TOO_MANY_BYTES` is the purest waste: the scan happened, the result was discarded — and it clusters into retry loops.
- **Background workloads mislabeled `ONLINE`** (`lc_kind='temporal' AND lc_workload='ONLINE'`) contend with user queries — worth flagging whenever it shows up big.
- Historically dominant buckets to expect: warehouse data modeling, insight refresh + HogQL API, cache warmup, error-tracking embeddings, experiment recalculation, cohort recalculation, and one-off backfills. Verify against the live data — the mix moves.

## Query mechanics (`posthog:execute-sql`)

- These are big scans (hundreds of millions of rows per month per region). A single-dimension GROUP BY over 30 days × both regions completes; heavier combinations time out — on timeout, narrow to one region and/or one week and extrapolate carefully.
- Transient 503s happen; retry once before restructuring.
- HogQL: `count()` not `count(*)`; results cap at 500 rows (`LIMIT` accordingly); don't select `query_shape` / `hogql_shape` / raw `query` blobs in wide aggregations.
- Per-org drill-downs: `INNER JOIN` the archive against `all_posthog_team` pre-filtered to the target org ids (small right side), one query per region.

## Reporting

Lead with: total per region and per day, read-vs-CPU share, the canonical product×feature table with % of total, the daily trend (one-off vs steady vs growing), concentration (top-10 orgs' share), free-vs-paying split, failed-query cost, and ranked recommendations with $/month attached.
Compare orgs' query cost to their MRR (`cost ÷ mrr`) — cost above MRR is a pricing/limits conversation, not an optimization.
State the caveats: coefficient provenance, window, archive coverage gaps, overlapping-lens warning, and that "paying" = `mrr > 0`.
