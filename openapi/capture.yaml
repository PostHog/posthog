    title: PostHog Capture API
    description: |
        As explained in our API overview page, PostHog provides two different APIs.

        This page refers to our public endpoints, which use the same API key as the
        PostHog snippet. The endpoints documented here are used solely with POST
        requests, and will not return any sensitive data from your PostHog instance.

            summary: Capture an event
            description: |
                Capture an event. Events are the core of PostHog, and are what you use
                to track user behavior, and then analyze and visualize in PostHog.
            responses:
                '200':
                    description: |
                        On successful capture of an event or events, we notify you with a
                        200 response. A 200 response guarantees that the event was persisted
                        by PostHog, but does not guarantee that it will be processed
                        successfully.

                        If you send an invalid request, we will return a 400 response. This
                        can happen if you send an invalid JSON payload among other things.
