# Defines the healthcheck endpoints to be used by process orchestration system
# deployments to ensure:

#  1. new deployments are not marked as ready if they are misconfigured, e.g.
#     kafka settings are wrong
#  2. pods that are dead for some reason are taken out of service
#  3. traffic is not routed to pods that we know we fail to handle it
#     successfully. e.g. if an events pod can't reach kafka, we know that it
#     shouldn't get http traffic routed to it.

# See
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/
# for generic k8s docs on healthchecks.

# I have specifically not reused the statuses in instance_status. These health
# endpoints are for a very specific purpose and we want to make sure that any
# changes to them are deliberate, as otherwise we could introduce unexpected
# behaviour in deployments.

    considered ready such that old workers are removed, within a k8s deployment.

    critical dependencies for each k8s deployment, e.g. the events pod 100%
    needs kafka to operate. For the web server however, this is debatable. The
    web server does a lot of stuff, and kafka is only used I believe for sending
    merge person events, so we'd rather stay up with degraded functionality,
    rather than take the website UI down.
