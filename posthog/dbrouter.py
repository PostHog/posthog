    A database router to route reads to a separate Aurora endpoint

    This adds opt-in routing for models, pointing them to the read replica.

    Many examples show several configured replicas. We use Aurora,
    so already have a load-balanced reader endpoint that handles this for us.
    Hence our database config has a single write endpoint, and single read endpoint.

    Please be aware that there is a small amount of lag (<100ms, usually significantly less)
    from the writer to reader instance. This means that you will face consistency issues if you
    immediately try and read a model you have just written.
