    `path_start_key`, `path_end_key`, and `path_dropoff_key` are three new params for this class.
    These determine the start and end point of Paths you want. All of these are optional.

    Not specifying them means "get me all users on this path query".

    Only specifying `path_start_key` means "get me all users whose paths start at this key"
    Only specifying `path_end_key` means "get me all users whose paths end at this key"

    Specifying both means "get me all users whose path starts at `start_key` and ends at `end_key`."

    Specifying `path_dropoff_key` means "get me users who dropped off after this key. If you specify
    this key, the other two keys are invalid

    Note that:
        Persons are calculated only between direct paths. There should not be any
        other path item between start and end key.
