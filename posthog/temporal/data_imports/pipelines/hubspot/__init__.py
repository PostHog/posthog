"""
This is a module that provides a DLT source to retrieve data from multiple endpoints of the HubSpot API using a specified API key. The retrieved data is returned as a tuple of Dlt resources, one for each endpoint.

The source retrieves data from the following endpoints:
- CRM Companies
- CRM Contacts
- CRM Deals
- CRM Tickets
- CRM Quotes
- Web Analytics Events

For each endpoint, a resource and transformer function are defined to retrieve data and transform it to a common format.
The resource functions yield the raw data retrieved from the API, while the transformer functions are used to retrieve
additional information from the Web Analytics Events endpoint.

The source also supports enabling Web Analytics Events for each endpoint by setting the corresponding enable flag to True.

Example:
To retrieve data from all endpoints, use the following code:

python

>>> resources = hubspot(api_key="hubspot_access_code")

    A DLT source that retrieves data from the HubSpot API using the
    specified API key.

    This function retrieves data for several HubSpot API endpoints,
    including companies, contacts, deals, tickets and web
    analytics events. It returns a tuple of Dlt resources, one for
    each endpoint.

    Args:
        api_key (Optional[str]):
            The API key used to authenticate with the HubSpot API. Defaults
            to dlt.secrets.value.
        include_history (Optional[bool]):
            Whether to load history of property changes along with entities.
            The history entries are loaded to separate tables.

    Returns:
        Sequence[DltResource]: Dlt resources, one for each HubSpot API endpoint.

    Notes:
        This function uses the `fetch_data` function to retrieve data from the
        HubSpot CRM API. The API key is passed to `fetch_data` as the
        `api_key` argument.
