# Warehouse sources — implementation status & communication methods

This file is the authoritative inventory of every source registered in [`posthog/temporal/data_imports/sources/__init__.py`](__init__.py),
the wire protocol it uses to talk to its upstream, and whether its outbound traffic is currently routed
through the [tracked HTTP transport](common/http/) (so it shows up in our HTTP logs, metrics, and
sample-capture pipeline).

Keep this file in sync as sources are added, implemented, or migrated. The [implementing-warehouse-sources
skill](/.agents/skills/implementing-warehouse-sources/SKILL.md) instructs agents to update it as part of any
new source / vendor-SDK / migration PR.

## Status legend

| Status                  | Meaning                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implemented**         | Source has working sync logic and is exposed to users (possibly behind `featureFlag=` or `releaseStatus="alpha"/"beta"`). |
| **Scaffolded**          | Source class is registered with `unreleasedSource=True` and an empty/placeholder `source.py`. No sync logic yet.           |

## Comm-method legend

| Method                          | Meaning                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP**                        | REST/JSON over HTTPS via the `requests` library. Routed through `make_tracked_session()` (see [common/http/](common/http/)).                                      |
| **HTTP (vendor SDK)**           | The vendor ships its own SDK that wraps HTTP. Where the SDK exposes a session/transport hook, we inject `make_tracked_session()` so the calls are still tracked. |
| **gRPC**                        | The vendor SDK uses gRPC over HTTP/2 (binary, not REST). The tracked HTTP transport does not currently apply.                                                    |
| **DB protocol**                 | Native database wire protocol via a driver (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake). Not HTTP.                                                                        |
| **Webhook (S3-buffered)**       | Vendor pushes events to a webhook endpoint; payloads are buffered to S3 by the `WebhookSourceManager` and consumed by the pipeline.                              |

When a source uses more than one transport (e.g. BigQuery REST + Storage gRPC, or Stripe pull-API + webhooks),
the row lists both.

## Tracked-transport legend

| State            | Meaning                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Tracked       | Outbound calls go through `make_tracked_session()` (or the equivalent vendor-SDK injection).                                              |
| ⚠️ Vendor SDK    | Vendor SDK has no session/transport hook we can use. Outbound HTTP bypasses our logging/metrics today. May need a `# nosemgrep` pragma. |
| ➖ N/A           | Source uses a non-HTTP protocol (DB driver, gRPC, etc.) — the HTTP transport doesn't apply.                                              |
| —                | Source is scaffolded; no transport in use yet.                                                                                            |

### Notes on partially-tracked sources

- **bing_ads** uses Microsoft's `bingads` Python SDK, which builds its own HTTP transport via `suds-py3` for
  the SOAP API and a separate Reporting client. The SDK does not expose a session or HTTP-client injection
  hook today. Outbound traffic from this source bypasses the tracked transport.
- **linkedin_ads** uses `linkedin-api`'s `RestliClient`, which constructs its own internal `requests.Session`.
  We don't yet have a session-injection seam on it, so outbound calls bypass the tracked transport. (The file
  imports `requests` only for exception types — those references are expected and don't need a pragma.)
- **bigquery's** Storage Read API uses gRPC; only the metadata/management traffic via the BigQuery REST API
  is HTTP, and that HTTP path is tracked via `AuthorizedSession` + a mounted `TrackedHTTPAdapter`.

## Scaffolded sources

These are registered in `__init__.py` with `unreleasedSource=True` and a stub `source.py`. They have no
sync logic yet — picking up any of them means following the [implementing-warehouse-sources skill](/.agents/skills/implementing-warehouse-sources/SKILL.md).

## When to update this file

Update SOURCES.md whenever you:

- **Add a new source** (move it from the scaffolded list into the implemented table once it actually syncs).
- **Implement an existing scaffolded source** (move it into the implemented table; record the comm method
  and tracked-transport state).
- **Migrate a vendor SDK** to use `make_tracked_session()` (flip the source from ⚠️ to ✅).
- **Switch a source's protocol** (e.g. swap a REST client for a gRPC SDK, or add webhook support
  alongside the pull API).

The semgrep rule [`data-imports-http-transport`](/.semgrep/rules/data-imports-http-transport.yaml) enforces
that direct `requests.<verb>` / `requests.Session()` / `httpx.*` calls inside `sources/` go through the
tracked transport. Vendor SDKs that genuinely cannot be intercepted should both:

1. Carry a `# nosemgrep: data-imports-http-transport-...` pragma at the call site, with a one-line reason.
2. Be listed here under "Notes on partially-tracked sources" with the `⚠️ Vendor SDK` row state.
