    Returns a ClickHouse client based on the aiochclient library. This is an
    async context manager.

    Usage:

        async with get_client() as client:
            await client.execute("SELECT 1")

    Note that this is not a connection pool, so you should not use this for
    queries that are run frequently.

    Note that we setup the SSL context here, allowing for custom CA certs to be
    used. I couldn't see a simply way to do this with `aiochclient` so we
    explicitly use `aiohttp` to create the client session with an ssl_context
    and pass that to `aiochclient`.
