This module provides utilities for transforming ClickHouse aggregate functions to their State and Merge variants.

ClickHouse supports a two-step aggregation pattern where:
1. Functions like uniq() can be converted to uniqState() for partial aggregation
2. These state functions can then be processed with uniqMerge() to combine partial results

This is useful for:
- Optimizing queries by enabling parallel processing and pre-aggregation
- Creating materialized views with partial aggregates
- Combining preaggregated data with real-time data in a single query
