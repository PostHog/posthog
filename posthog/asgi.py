    When connecting to the prod DB locally, we need foreign keys associated with the user we're impersonating to exist locally.

    Rationale:
    If we don't ensure this, then we can't use the local DB for any writes. An example is the AI Conversation model:
    for a Conversation to be started, it needs to be persisted. We can't do this in the prod DB, as we're only reading it,
    so we do it locally. For the local write to work, the `team_id` and `user_id` foreign keys must resolve in the local DB
    as well as in the prod one.
