    """Return an *async* Redis client bound to *this* event-loop.

    This is safe when multiple :pyclass:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop` objects exist in the
    same Python process (that happens anytime someone calls
    :pyfunc:`asyncio.run`, which we unfortunately do in a few endpoints and
    management commands).
    It does not leak file-descriptors or memory when those short-lived event-loops
    disappear.

    The synchronous helper (`get_client`) is trivial â€“ we can keep a single process-wide
    singleton.  The asynchronous side is trickier because an ``aioredis.Redis``
    instance is bound to the event-loop in which it was created. Using the same
    client from another loop raises

    ``RuntimeError: Task ... got Future attached to a different loop``.

    To make this bullet-proof we cache one Redis instance
    per (event-loop, redis_url) pair and keep that cache in a
    ``weakref.WeakKeyDictionary``. When a loop is garbage-collected (which happens
    immediately after ``asyncio.run`` returns) its entry in the weak dict
    disappears and we close all the connection pools via a ``weakref.finalize``.

    This gives us:

    * zero cross-loop accidents (each pool is only ever used by the loop that
      created it),
    * zero leaks (pools are closed as soon as their loop dies),
    * no behavioural change for callers (they still just call
      :pyfunc:`get_async_client`).

    If you *really* need to bypass the cache, just call ``aioredis.from_url``
    directly; but in 99 % of cases you want the cached client.
