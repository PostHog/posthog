# This loads historical data from `historical.csv`
# and generates a dictionary containing all entries for all dates and all currencies
# from January 1st 2000 to December 31st 2024
#
# All of the rates are in comparison to the USD at that time.
# There's no inflation adjustment, that would be nonsense.
# If you want to convert from currency A to currency B, you need to:
# 1. Convert A to USD
# 2. Convert USD to B
#
# This is easily achieved by: `amount` B = `amount` A * `rate_A` / `rate_B`
#
# This CSV was originally downloaded from https://github.com/xriss/freechange/blob/master/csv/usd_to_xxx_by_day.csv
# and then slightly optimized:
# 1. Remove all dates older than 2000-01-01
# 2. Truncate all rates to 4 decimal places
# 3. Remove USD because it's the base currency, therefore it's always 1:1
# 4. Add some rates for less known currencies from https://fxtop.com/en/historical-currency-converter.php
# 5. Add BTC rates from https://github.com/Habrador/Bitcoin-price-visualization/blob/main/Bitcoin-price-USD.csv, and manual from the cutoff onwards
#
# The resulting CSV is stored in `historical.csv`
#
# This won't return values for dates where we didn't have a value.
# When querying the table/dictionary, you'll need to look for the previous closest date with a value.
