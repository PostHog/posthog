## API Scopes
# These are the scopes that are used to define the permissions of the API tokens.
# Not every model needs a scope - it should more be for top-level things
# Typically each object should have `read` and `write` scopes, but some objects may have more specific scopes

# WARNING: Make sure to keep in sync with the frontend!
