    """
    Executes a SQL query on each node separately with specific options, handling distributed execution and node roles.

    This function executes a given SQL statement with the ability to target specific
    roles and node configurations. It supports distributed query execution for sharded
    or non-sharded deployments and takes into account cluster configurations. Additionally,
    it accommodates operations such as those on replicated tables.

    Parameters:
    sql: str
        The SQL query to be executed.
    node_roles: List of roles to execute the migration on, optional (default is NodeRole.DATA if not specified)
        Specifies which type of node the query should target during execution.
        In general, run everything on NodeRole.DATA and NodeRole.COORDINATOR except changes to sharded tables / writable distributed tables.
    sharded: bool, optional (default is False)
        Indicates if the migration is on a sharded table
    is_alter_on_replicated_table: bool, optional (default is False)
        Specifies whether the query is an ALTER statement executed on replicated tables.
        This will run on just one host per shard or one host for the whole cluster if there is no sharding.

    Returns:
    migrations.RunPython
        A high-level representation capable of running the migration query in the specified
        context, including its distribution across nodes based on input parameters.

    Raises:
    AssertionError
        Raised in certain scenarios when the input arguments conflict with the expected
        configuration, such as when the sharded flag is set for roles other than DATA.
