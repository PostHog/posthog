# Methods used for rendering a ClickHouse query, given a template string and a
# set of parameters.
#
# This uses the `escape_param` function from the `clickhouse-driver` package,
# but passes an empty `Context` object to it. Prior to
# https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver/commit/87090902f0270ed51a0b6754d5cbf0dc8544ec4b
# the `escape_param` function didn't take a `Context` object. As of
# `clickhouse-driver` 0.2.4 all it uses the context for is to determine the
# "server" timezone, so passing an empty context maintains the existing
# behaviour of `clickhouse-driver` 0.2.1, the version we were previously using.
#
# This is of course a bit of a hack but we want to be able to render queries
# without the need of having a connection, which seems like a reasonable thing
# to be able to do. Having a dependency on a connection to render a query is a
# little over the top.
#
# NOTE: this change is necessary because the `clickhouse-driver` package up to
# 0.2.3 uses an invalid `python_requires` in it's `setup.py` at least for
# recent versions of setuptools. This was highlighted as a consequence of
# upgrading to Python 3.10. See
# https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver/pull/291 for further context.

    This is a copy of clickhouse-driver's `substitute_params` function without
    the dependency that you need to connect to the server before you can escape

    the connection was established, which caused the query to fail. Presumably
    this was on initial worker startup only.

    It seems somewhat unusual that you need to connect to the server before
    you can escape params, so we're just going to copy the function here
    and remove that dependency.
