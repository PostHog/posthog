        Migration 0227 loaded layouts via SQL query from insights and then saved them to dashboard tiles
        That assumed that when loaded they were dicts.
        However, when a Django model saves a JSONField it runs `jsons.dumps(field)` so it is saving a string
        0227 loaded that string, passed it into a model, and saved it
        So it had effectively had `json.dumps(json.dumps(field)` run on it

        In the meantime if anyone has edited a dashboard the layout will have been saved correctly
        (as a singly string stringified dict)

        A migration to fix that needs to cope with both singly and doubly stringified dicts)
