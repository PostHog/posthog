    <p>
        We can't wait for you to try everything PostHog offers, from funnel analysis and feature flags to session
        recordings and experimentation. But first you'll need to send us some events…

    <ul>
        <li class="mb">
            <strong>If you're an engineer:</strong> Integrate PostHog using

            <strong>If you're <i>not</i> an engineer:</strong>

            <a href="{% absolute_uri '/organization/settings' %}?{{ utm_tags }}" target="_blank"><strong>Invite a colleague with code access</strong></a> so
            they can set it up for you. PostHog works best with friends anyway.
        </li>
        <li class="mb">
            <strong>If you just want to play around:</strong>
            <a

                ><b>Try our demo environment</b></a
            >
            to get hands-on with some sample data straight away. All the fun, none of the installation.
